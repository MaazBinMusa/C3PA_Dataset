This ensures that these users are only shown advertisements that match their interests and that inconveniences caused by inappropriate advertising are avoided. By using the Facebook Pixel, we can also monitor the effectiveness of our Facebook advertisements for statistical purposes and track whether and how a user has used our services after clicking on an advertisement.\n\nAdditional information about the Facebook Pixel and how it works can be found here. Detailed information on how Facebook processes the data it collects and general information about Facebook advertisements can be found in Facebook’s Data Policy.
