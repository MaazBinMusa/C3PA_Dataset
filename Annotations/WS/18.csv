If we are able to identify you as a Target Guest we may, for example, link your activity on our website to your activity in a Target store or on one of our mobile application(s). This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us – online, in store, mobile, etc.\n\nIn order to provide the best Guest experience possible and run our business operations, we also use automated information collection technologies for reporting and analysis purposes.
