ra3,"Information You Provide Directly to Us\n\nYou may provide us with information about you when you use or access the Platform, such as when you register for an account; participate in polls or surveys; enroll for electronic newsletters; request a quote or other information; submit or respond to a quote; make a purchase; fill out any forms; enter a sweepstakes or contest, or register for a promotion; transmit User Content; download or use one of our mobile applications; you consent to our collection of information, such as when you grant us permission to collect your device’s contact list; or otherwise communicate with us or other Users through the Platform. This list is illustrative, not exhaustive; this Policy applies to all your uses of the Platform.\n\nThe personal information you provide directly to us may include, but is not limited to: (a) name; (b) zip code; (c) email address; (d) home or business telephone number; (e) home, business or mailing address; (f) demographic information (e.g., gender, age, and other information relevant to User surveys and/or offers); (g) date of birth and/or age verification; (h) insurance information (if you are a Service Professional); (i) photographs and/or video files or audio files (e.g., customer service call recordings); (j) information about your project, home, request or need; (k) in certain circumstances, payment information; (l) if you are a Service Professional, in certain circumstances, identity verification information (such as Social Security number or driver’s license information); and/or (m) any other information you include in communications with other Users through the Platform or communications with us. It may also include your information specific to the services you are requesting or offering through the Platform, such as a business name, service description, qualifications and credentials. You are not required to provide us with such information, but certain features of the Platform may not be accessible or available, absent the provision of the requested information.\n\nWe utilize a third-party payment provider to process payment information (e.g., credit card information or bank account information).\n\nInformation from Affiliates, Social Networking Sites, and Other Non-Affiliated Sources\n\nWe may collect information about you through Thumbtack affiliates or through non-affiliated sources, including public information sources. For example:\n\nYou may be able to access the Platform through a social networking account, such as Facebook. If you access the Platform through your Facebook account, you may allow us to have access to certain information in your Facebook profile. This may include your name, profile picture, gender, networks, user IDs, list of friends, location, date of birth, email address, photos, videos, people you follow and/or who follow you, and/or your posts or ""likes."" Social networking sites, such as Facebook, have their own policies for handling your information. For a description of how these sites may use and disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult those sites' privacy policies.\nTo the extent permitted by law, we may, in our sole discretion, ask for and collect supplemental information about you from non-affiliated sources, such as information about your credit from a credit bureau, or information to verify your identity or trustworthiness, or for other fraud or safety protection purposes. We may combine information that we collect from you through the Platform with information that we obtain from such sources, including public information sources and information derived from any other products or services we provide.\nWe may collect information that demonstrates the occurrence of an off-Platform communication between a Consumer and a Service Professional in order to ensure accurate charging of fees imposed upon Service Professionals and to enforce the Terms of Use. Except as explicitly stated herein, we will not collect or store the contents of any off-Platform communication between a Consumer and a Service Professional.\nIf you send text messages with a Consumer or Service Professional using the telephone number for that User available on the Platform, we may use a third-party vendor to track these text messages. We track these text messages for fraud prevention, to ensure appropriate charging of fees, to enforce our Terms of Use, and for quality and training purposes. As part of this process, Thumbtack and the third-party vendor will receive in real time and store data about your text message, including the date and time of the text message, your phone number, and the content of the text message.\nPlease note that we have no control over how any third-party site uses or discloses the information it collects about you.\n\nInformation That Is Passively or Automatically Collected\n\nDevice/Usage Information. We and certain third-party vendors, including ad networks and analytics providers, may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information about the computers or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Platform. As described further below, we and these third-party vendors may collect and analyze information including but not limited to (a) browser type; (b) ISP or operating system; (c) domain name; (d) access time; (e) referring or exit pages; (f) page views; (g) IP address; (h) unique device identifiers (e.g. IDFA or Android ID); and (i) the type of device that you use. We may also track and record when and how frequently you access or use the Platform, or how you browse the Platform. We do not, however, collect keystroke information. We use this information (including the information collected by relevant third-party vendors) for Platform analytics (including to determine which portions of the Platform are used most frequently and what our Users like/do not like), to assist in determining relevant advertising (both on and off the Platform), to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns, and as otherwise described in this Policy.\n\nLocation Information. When you use the Platform, we may collect general location information (such as your location as derived from your IP address). If you install our mobile app, depending on your device settings and any permissions you have granted, we may collect information about your precise geolocation, and we may use that information to improve the Platform, including providing you with location-based features (e.g., for identification of Pro Services available near you). To deliver customized content and advertising, we may disclose your location information to our agents, vendors, or advertisers. If you access the Platform through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with location-tracking information, you may be able to disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device. See your device manufacturer's instructions for further details. If you disable certain functions, you may be unable to use certain parts of the Platform.\n\nCookies and Other Electronic Technologies. We and our third-party vendors may use cookies, clear GIFs, pixel tags, and other technologies that help us better understand User behavior, personalize preferences, perform research and analytics, and improve the Platform. These technologies, for example, may allow us to tailor the Platform to your needs, save your password in password-protected areas, track the pages you visit, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Platform usage. We also use certain of these technologies to deliver advertisements through the Platform that may interest you or to advertise ourselves and the Platform to you on other sites. We or our third-party vendors also may use certain of these technologies in emails to our Users to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.\n\nYou can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but your browser may allow you to modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer. If you disable cookies, you may be prevented from taking full advantage of the Platform, because it may not function properly. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.",Categories of Personal Information Collected

We may use de-identified or aggregated information for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes and may also disclose such information to any third parties, including without limitation, advertisers, promotional partners, sponsors, event promoters, and/or others.\n\nWe may, either directly or through third-party providers we engage to provide services to us, review, scan, or analyze your communications with other Users exchanged via the Platform or as otherwise described in this Policy for fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research and User support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts, we may scan and analyze messages to prevent fraud or improper actions.
