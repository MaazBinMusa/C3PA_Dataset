ra3,"What data do you collect about me?\nYou give some data, we get some data. In return we offer useful services. Not what you had in mind? Check your settings.\n\n \n1. Information We Collect\n\nThe information we collect when you use X falls into three categories.\n\nExpand dropdowns for more information:\n\n\nTo use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and to create an account, you need to provide us certain information. Likewise, if you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you without getting payment information. Basically, certain information is necessary if you want to use many of our products and services.\n\nPersonal Accounts. If you create an account, you must provide us with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This includes a display name (for example, “Creators”); a username (for example, @XCreators); a password; an email address or phone number; a date of birth; your display language; and third-party single sign-in information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also choose to share your location in your profile and posts, and to upload your address book to X to help find people you may know. Your profile information, which includes your display name and username, is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. And remember, you can create multiple X accounts, for example, to express different parts of your identity, professional or otherwise. \n\nProfessional Accounts. If you create a professional account, you also need to provide us with a professional category, and may provide us with other information, including street address, contact email address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public. \n\nPayment Information. In order to purchase ads or other offerings provided as part of our paid products and services you will need to provide us payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address.\n\nPreferences. When you set your preferences using your settings, we collect that information so that we can respect your preferences.\n\nBiometric Information. Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes.\n\nJob Applications / Recommendations. We may collect and use your personal information (such as your employment history, educational history, employment preferences, skills and abilities, job search activity and engagement, and so on) to recommend potential jobs for you, to share with potential employers when you apply for a job, to enable employers to find potential candidates, and to show you more relevant advertising.\n\n\nWhen you use our services, we collect information about how you use our products and services. We use that information to provide you with products and services, to help keep X more secure and respectful for everyone, and more relevant to you.\n \n\n\nUsage Information. We collect information about your activity on X, including:\n\nPosts and other content you post (including the date, application, and version of X) and information about your broadcast activity (e.g., Spaces), including broadcasts you’ve created and when you created them, your lists, bookmarks, and communities you are a part of.\nYour interactions with other users’ content, such as reposts, likes, bookmarks, shares, replies, if other users mention or tag you in content or if you mention or tag them, and broadcasts you’ve participated in (including your viewing history, listening, commenting, speaking, and reacting).\nHow you interact with others on the platform, such as people you follow and people who follow you, metadata related to Encrypted Messages, and when you use Direct Messages, including the contents of the messages, the recipients, and date and time of messages.\nIf you communicate with us, such as through email, we will collect information about the communication and its content.\nWe collect information on links you interact with across our services (including in our emails sent to you).\nPurchase and payments. To allow you to make a payment or send money using X features or services, including through an intermediary, we may receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, when a subscription is set to expire or auto-renew, and amounts paid or received.\n\nDevice Information. We collect information from and about the devices you use to access X, including:\n\nInformation about your connection, such as your IP address, browser type, and related information.\nInformation about your device and its settings, such as device and advertising ID, operating system, carrier, language, memory, apps installed, and battery level.\nYour device address book, if you’ve chosen to share it with us.\n\nLocation Information. When you use X, we collect some information about your approximate location to provide the service you expect, including showing you relevant ads. You can also choose to share your current precise location or places where you’ve previously used X by enabling these settings in your account.\n\n\nInferred Identity. We may collect or receive information that we use to infer your identity as detailed below:\nWhen you sign into X on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to sign into X (or associate your signed-out device or browser with other browsers or devices or X-generated identifiers).\nWhen you provide other information to X, including an email address or phone number, we associate that information with your X account. Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common components with the email address you have provided to X.\nWhen you access X and are not signed in, we may infer your identity based on the information we collect.\n\nLog Information. We may receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our products and services, even if you have not created an account or are signed out, such as:\n\nIP address and related information; browser type and language; operating system; the referring webpage; access times; pages visited; location; your mobile carrier; device information (including device and application IDs); search terms and IDs (including those not submitted as queries); ads shown to you on X; X-generated identifiers; and identifiers associated with cookies. We also receive log information when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services, including when you install another application through X.\n\nAdvertisements. When you view or interact with ads we serve on or off X, we may collect information about those views or interactions (e.g., watching a video ad or preroll, clicking on an ad, interacting with reposts of or replies to an ad). \nCookies and similar technologies. Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our products and services such as searching and looking at public profiles. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
ra3," How We Use Information\n\nBreaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single service. We think it’s most useful to describe the five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always contact us. Here we go:\n\nExpand dropdowns for more information:\n \n\n \n\nWe use the information we collect to provide and operate X products and services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize our products and services so that you have a better experience on X, including by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to follow, enabling and helping you discover affiliates, third-party apps, and services. We may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purposes outlined in this policy.\n\nWe may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that you choose to connect your X account to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services.\n\nWe use your contact information to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications.\n\n\nWe use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content services subject to your settings, which helps make ads on X more relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the effectiveness of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of X. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.\n\n\nWe use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud, unauthorized use, and illegal activity. We also use the information to evaluate and affect the safety and quality of content on X - this includes investigating and enforcing our policies and and terms, as well as applicable law.\n \n\n\nWe use the information we collect to measure and analyze the effectiveness of our products and services and to better understand how you use them in order to make them better.\n\n\nWe use the information we collect to communicate with you about our products and services, including about product updates and changes to our policies and terms. If you’re open to hearing from us, we may also send you marketing messages from time to time.\n\n\nWe use information you share with us, or that we collect to conduct research, surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting to help us operate and improve our products and services.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
ra3,"How or when do you share my information?\nThere’s no quick answer to this one, but heads up: posts can end up in the news or a search engine.\n\n3. Sharing Information\n\nYou should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information.\n\nExpand dropdowns for more information:\n \n\n \n\nWith the general public. You are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible. X content, including your profile information (e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available for viewing by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to view some content on X. They may also find X content off of X, for example from search query results on Internet search engines.\n\nWith other X users. Depending on your settings, and based on the X products and services you use, we share:\n\nYour interactions with X content of other users, such as likes, and people you follow.\nContent you send to a specific X user, such as through Direct Messages. Please keep in mind that if you’ve shared information like Direct Messages or protected posts with someone else who accesses X through a third-party service, the information may be shared with the third-party service.\nWith partners. Depending on your settings, we also provide certain third parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our Help Center. You can control whether X shares your personal information with these partners by using the “Data sharing with business partners” option in your Privacy & Safety settings. (This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, such as when we share information with our service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in this Help Center article.)\n \n\n\nWith service providers. We may share your information with our service providers that perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including payment services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host our various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use of our services; applicant tracking system providers to send and receive applicant and job data to potential employers; and those that provide fraud detection services. \n\nWith advertisers. Advertising revenue enables us to provide our products and services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement with their ads on or off X. For example, if you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from X, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked, such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and other X-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other personal information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP address.\n\nThird-party content & integrations. We share or disclose your information with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. Similarly, to improve your experience, we work with third-party partners to display their video content on X or to allow cross-platform sharing. When you watch or otherwise interact with content from our video or cross-platform sharing partners, they may receive and process your personal information as described in their privacy policies. For video content, you can adjust your autoplay settings if you prefer that content not to play automatically.\n\nThrough our APIs. We use technology like APIs and embeds to make public X information available to websites, apps, and others for their use, for example, displaying posts on a news website or analyzing what people say on X. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have standard terms that govern how this information can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with X, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on X. For more information about how we make public data on X available to the world, visit https://developer.x.com.\n \n\n\nWe may preserve, use, share, or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to:\n\ncomply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request;\n\nprotect the safety of any person, protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services;\n\nexplain why we have removed content or accounts from our services (e.g., for a violation of Our Rules);\n\naddress fraud, security, or technical issues; or\n\nprotect our rights or property, or the rights or property of those who use our services.\n\n\nWe may share information amongst our affiliates to provide our products and services.\n\n\nWe may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal information that is shared with (before and after the close of any transaction) or transferred to the new entity.",Categories of Personal Information Shared / Disclosed

Changes To This Privacy Policy\nThe most current version of this Privacy Policy governs our processing of your personal data and we may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time as needed.\n\nIf we do revise this Privacy Policy and make changes that are determined by us to be material, we will provide you notice and an opportunity to review the revised Privacy Policy before you continue to use X.",Updated Privacy Policy
