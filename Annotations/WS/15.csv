ra3,"What Information Do We Gather about You?\n\nThe information we gather about you depends on the context. By and large, it’s information about you that can personally identify you — either on its own or when combined with other information.\n\nThe following describes the information we collect and how we obtain it.\n\n1. (A) Information Collected through Times Services.\n\ni. Information You Voluntarily Give Us\n\nFor Registration:\nWhen you sign up for a Times Service (e.g., a subscription), we collect your contact information and account credentials. Once you’re registered, we assign you a unique ID number. This ID number helps us recognize you when you’re signed in.\n\nFor some Times Services, you can instead sign up by linking your Apple, Facebook or Google account. See Information Collected From Other Sources below.\n\nIf you register for an event or conference, we might ask for additional information (e.g., your company name, your job title or your dietary restrictions).\n\nFor Billing:\nTo process payments or donations, we collect and use your payment information.\n\nThis can include your name, your address, your telephone number, your email address, your credit or debit card information and any other relevant information.\n\nFor User-Generated Content:\nWe offer you the ability to post content that other users can read (e.g., comments or recipe reviews). Anyone can read, collect and use any personal information that accompanies your posts. See the Comments F.A.Q., or read the User-Generated Content section in our Terms of Service for more information.\n\nWe do not have to publish any of your content. If the law requires us to take down, remove or edit your personal information, we will comply to the required extent.\n\nFor Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers:\nWhen you sign up for these, you give us your name, email and any other required information.\n\nFor Reader Surveys, Research, Panels and Experience Programs:\nWe gather information through questionnaires, surveys and feedback programs, including demographic information like your age, ethnicity, race, or gender. We also conduct similar research for advertisers. We ask you for your consent to use this information when you participate in these programs and events.\n\nDuring Contact with Our Call Centers:\nWe collect information from you when you place an order over the phone or contact customer service through one of our toll-free numbers. This can include your name, contact information and any other information you choose to provide.\n\nPersonal Contacts Data:\nWe never scan your device for your contacts or upload that data.\n\nWith your consent, we do comply with your requests to collect data about your friends, family or acquaintances (e.g., Refer a Friend campaigns). This functionality is only meant for U.S. residents. By using it, you acknowledge and agree that both you and your contacts are based in the United States — and that you have everyone’s consent for us to use their contact information.\n\nii. Information Collected Automatically\n\nWhen you use Times Services, we collect some information automatically. The technologies we use to assist with this data collection include cookies, web beacons, tags and scripts and software development kits (or SDKs). We use these technologies on our digital properties, including our websites and apps, as well as in our email communications and newsletters. For more information about tracking methods on Times Services, and how to manage them, read our Cookie Policy and the What Are Your Rights and Choices? section below.\n\nThe categories of personal information we collect automatically include:\n\nIdentifiers and Device Information:\nWhen you visit our Services, including our websites, apps, email communications and newsletters, our servers automatically log information about the device you are using, including unique identifiers. If your browser doesn’t accept our cookies or similar technologies, you can’t access certain parts of our websites (e.g., your account on nytimes.com). The items we log include:\n\nYour IP address\nCookie identifiers\nYour operating system and browser (e.g., type, version, and configuration)\nYour browser language\nDevice identifiers (such as MAC address)\nAdvertising identifiers\nWe combine this data with other information we collect about you. \n\nGeolocation Information:\nSome of our apps can provide content based on your GPS location if you enable this feature. Your GPS location is your precise geolocation, which is considered a type of sensitive personal information.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
ra3,"Other Usage Data:\nWe collect certain internet and network activity on our Services, including our websites and apps, such as the URLs of any pages you visit on our sites and apps, the URL of the website from which you came to our sites, how long you spent on a page, access times and other details about your use of and actions on our Services.\n\niii. A Note about Sensitive Personal Information\n\nWe generally don’t want to gather sensitive information about you. This includes:\n\nGovernment-issued IDs (such as your driver’s license, passport or social security number)\nYour racial or ethnic origin\nYour political opinions\nYour religion or other beliefs\nYour health, biometric or genetic characteristics\nAny trade union membership\nYour sexuality (information about your sex life or sexual orientation)\nAny criminal background\nThe content of your private communications (other than messages you may send to us)\nHowever, as discussed above, we sometimes collect precise geolocation information (which may be considered a sensitive data type) to provide GPS-based location services you choose to enable. Also, some laws define account access information, such as a username and password, as sensitive personal information, but we collect that information only for the accounts you create directly with us and not for any other account you may have with a third party.\n\nFinally, there are situations when we request certain of the above information (e.g., a reader survey asks about your political leanings or ethnicity), but you can decline to answer. Outside those situations we would prefer you never share these types of information with us.\n\n1. (B) Information We Create or Generate.\n\nWe infer new information from other data we collect, including using automated means to generate information about your likely preferences or other characteristics (“inferences”).",Categories of Personal Information Collected
ra3,"C) Information Collected from Other Sources.\n\ni. Privately Owned Databases:\n\nMarketing, data analytic and social media-owned databases give us access to a range of information — like public data, survey data and more. This data sometimes includes your mailing address, your gender, your age, your household income and other demographic data.",Categories of Personal Information Collected

ra3,"What Do We Do with the Information We Collect about You?\n\nWe use each of the categories of personal information described above for the following business and commercial purposes. The activities below can involve outside companies, agents or contractors (“service providers”) to whom we disclose your personal information for these purposes (discussed further below in Section 3 of this Privacy Policy).\n\n2. (A) We Provide the Times Services.\n\nWe use your information to help you use and navigate Times Services, such as:\n\nMaking a Times Service available to you\nArranging access to your account\nProviding customer service\nResponding to your inquiries, requests, suggestions or complaints\nCompleting your payments and transactions\nSending service-related messages (e.g., a change in our terms and conditions)\nSaving your reading list, recipes or property searches\nDisplaying your Games (including Crossword, Wordle, and Spelling Bee) stats\nLetting you take part in paid services, polls, promotions, surveys, panels, research and comments.\n2. (B) We Personalize Your Experience.\n\nWe track your interests and reading habits (e.g., the articles you read) to personalize your reading experience using technology like algorithmic recommendations and machine learning. This is how we highlight articles you might be interested in and de-emphasize articles you’ve already read. For more information about content personalization on Times Services, you can read the Personalization F.A.Q. We also show you prices, promotions, products or services we believe you’ll find interesting, based on demographic and usage data.\n\n2. (C) We Allow You to Share User-Generated Content.\n\nAny information you disclose in your content becomes public — along with your chosen screen name and uploaded photo.\n\n2. (D) We Develop Products and Services, and Do Analysis.\n\nWe analyze data on our users’ subscriptions, purchases and usage behaviors. This helps us make business and marketing decisions.\n\nFor example, our analysis, which includes the use of technology like machine learning, lets us predict preferences and price points for our products and services. It helps us determine whether our marketing is successful. It also shows us characteristics about our readers, which we sometimes share in aggregate with advertisers.\n\nGoogle Analytics is one of the analytics providers we use. You can find out how Google Analytics uses data and how to opt out of Google Analytics.\n\n2. (E) We Carry Out Administrative Tasks.\n\nFor auditing: We verify that our internal processes work as intended and comply with legal, regulatory and contractual requirements.\nFor fraud and security monitoring: We detect and prevent cyberattacks or unauthorized robot activities.\nFor customer satisfaction: We assess users’ satisfaction with Times Services and our customer care team.\n2. (F) We Offer Sweepstakes, Contests and Other Promotions.\n\nYou can take part in our sweepstakes, contests and other promotions. Some might have additional rules about how we use and disclose your personal information.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
ra3,"We Allow for Personalized Advertising on Times Services and Create Audiences for Third-Party Advertisers.\n\nWe gather data and work with third parties to show you personalized ads on behalf of advertisers. This data comes from ad tracking technologies set by us or the third party (e.g., cookies), the information you provide (e.g., your email address), your use of Times Services (e.g., your reading history), information from advertisers or advertising vendors (e.g., demographic data) and anything inferred from any of this information. We only use or share this information in a manner that does not reveal your identity. For example, we use Google to serve ads on Times Services. Google uses cookies or unique device identifiers, in combination with their own data, to show you ads based on your visit to nytimes.com and other sites. You can opt out of the use of the Google cookie by visiting the related Google privacy policy.\n\nWe also identify groups of users to whom to serve personalized ads on behalf of our advertisers. To do this, we combine information we collect through surveys or registration with information we collect automatically using tracking technologies while you browse our sites and apps. This combined information is used to build models. These data models are then used to measure users’ attributes, like their demographic information or their interests. Working with service providers, we use these measurements to group users by common attributes. Each group is associated with a random ID which is then passed to our ad server for use in targeting ad campaigns on our sites and apps.\n\nAnother example is our affiliate link vendors, which we use in our guides and product recommendations. Times Services include links that will send you to vendor URLs and other services not operated or controlled by us. These vendors use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your navigation from the Times Services to the merchant you are visiting. If you buy a product after following a link to a link vendor’s URL, we may earn a commission.",Categories of Personal Information Sold
