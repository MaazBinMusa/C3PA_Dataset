This may include performance information, along with web browsing, location and video viewing information.\n\nHere are detailed examples of types of information we collect from our Products or Services:\nAccount Information includes things like contact and billing information, service-related details and history and similar information, including Customer Proprietary Network Information.

For example, we use network tools to collect information like call and text records and the web browsing information we describe in this Policy.\nWe get it from outside sources like credit reports, marketing mailing lists, and commercially available geographic and demographic information, along with other available information, such as public posts to social networking sites.\nClose\nHow we use your information\nWe use your information, together with the information from testing and running our network, to power our services and to improve your experiences.

This is based on things like the information we’ve collected and our research, development and analysis.\nDesigning and delivering advertising and marketing campaigns to you and others and measuring their effectiveness.

ra3,"How we share your information\nWe share it with your permission.\nWe share it across AT&T companies.\nWe share it with non-AT&T companies or entities as explained in this Policy. For more details about how your information may be shared for advertising and marketing see Privacy Choices and Controls.\nSharing information across the AT&T affiliates\nLike many large companies, AT&T is made up of many affiliates. Our Products and Services are developed, managed, marketed and sold by a variety of our affiliates. We share information that may identify you personally internally among AT&T affiliatesButton Icon , such as DIRECTV and Cricket. For information collected under this Policy, we require the affiliate to use, share and protect the information consistent with this Policy including honoring your communications preferences for first-party marketing of their products and services, your advertising consents and your State Data Rights and Choices. We may also combine information that identifies you personally with data that comes from an app or affiliate that has a different privacy policy. When we do that, our Policy applies to the combined data set.\n\nSharing information with non-AT&T companies that provide services for us or for you\nWe share information that identifies you personally with vendors that perform services for us or that support Products or Services provided to you, including marketing or ad delivery services. We do not require consent for sharing with our vendors for these purposes. We do not allow those vendors to use your information for any purpose other than to perform those services, and we require them to protect the confidentiality and security of data they get from us in a way that’s consistent with this Policy.\n\nSharing information with non-AT&T companies to enable Identity Verification\nWe may share information with non-AT&T companies for their purposes to provide you services such as verifying or authenticating your identity, detecting fraud, protecting your financial accounts, and authorizing transactions. We do not allow those non-AT&T companies to use it for any purpose other than to perform those services, and we require them to protect the confidentiality and security of data they get from us in a way that’s consistent with this Policy. You are in control of this sharing. If you’re an AT&T Prepaid customer, text “STOP” to 8010 to stop sharing with Identity Verification or “RESUME” to restart sharing at any time. Other customers can opt out of Identity Verification at att.com/PrivacyChoices.\n\nSharing information with other non-AT&T companies or entities\nThere are also times when we provide information that identifies you personally to other companies and entities, such as government agencies, credit bureaus and collection agencies, without your consent, but where authorized or required by law. Reasons to share include:\n\nComplying with court orders, subpoenas, lawful discovery requests and as otherwise authorized or required by law. Like all companies, we are required by law to provide information to government and law enforcement agencies, as well as parties to civil lawsuits. You can find out more about this in our Transparency Report.\nDetecting and preventing fraud.\nProviding or obtaining payment for your service.\nRouting your calls or other communications.\nEnsuring network operations and security.\nNotifying, responding or providing information (including location) to a responsible governmental entity in emergency circumstances such as immediate danger of death or serious physical injury.\nAlerting the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to information concerning child pornography of which we become aware through the provision of our services. \nEnforcing our legal rights, protecting our network and property or defending against legal claims.\nComplying with legal requirements to share the names, addresses and telephone numbers of non-mobile phone customers with phone directory publishers and directory assistance services. We honor your request for non-published or non-listed numbers.\nProviding name and number information for wireline and wireless CallerID and related services, like Call Trace. This means a person receiving a call can see the name and number of the caller.\nSharing Aggregate Metrics Reports with non-AT&T companies\nSometimes the services you enjoy from us directly involve other businesses. For example, we may collect information, including location and web browsing data, from visitors to places where we provide Wi-Fi services.  In such cases, we aggregate the data before we use or share it with our business customers and service suppliers, which means that we group the information so that it does not identify you personally. We require that these metrics reports only be used for aggregate insights and that no one attempt to identify any person or device using this information.  Consistent with this Policy, we also require that our metrics reports be handled in a secure manner and that the information included be used only for aggregate insights to enable the marketing or improvement of Products and Services.\n\nSharing Aggregate Insights\nWe may share insights with non-AT&T companies about AT&T’s operations, network or services derived from aggregated customer data (data grouped so as not to identify you personally).\n\nSharing information for research\nWe may share information that doesn’t identify you personally with other companies and entities for research.  When we share this information, we require companies and entities to agree not to attempt or to allow others to use it to identify individuals.  Our agreements will also prevent businesses from reusing or reselling the information, and require that they will handle it in a secure manner, consistent with this Policy.\n\nSharing information with AT&T affiliates and non-AT&T companies for advertising and marketing programs\nWe may share information with AT&T affiliates and with non-AT&T companies to deliver or assess effectiveness of advertising and marketing campaigns as described in Privacy Choices and Controls.\n\nSharing information to support location services\nLocation services rely on, use or incorporate the location of a device to provide or enhance the service. Location services may collect and use or share location information to power applications on your device (those that are pre-loaded or those that you chose to download), such as mapping and traffic apps, or other location services you subscribe to.  AT&T will not share your location information for location services without your consent (to us or a company providing you service), except as required by law. If you purchase location services from another company, such as a medical alerting device company, the use or disclosure of location information is governed by the agreement between you and the service provider, including any applicable privacy policy of the service provider, and is not governed by this Policy. In other cases – for example parental controls services - the account holder for the location services, instead of a user, may initiate or subscribe to the location services and provide the required consent.",Categories of Personal Information Shared / Disclosed
