ra3,"How we share the information we collect\nWe share personal data as described below, including with your consent or as necessary to complete your transactions or provide the services you have requested or authorized. In addition, we may share each of the categories of your personal data described above with the types of third parties described below for the following business purposes:\n\nPublic information\nYou may select options available through our Service to publicly display and share your name and/or username and certain other information, such as your profile, demographic data, content and files, or geolocation data. For example, if you would like your email address to remain private, even when you’re commenting on public repositories, you can adjust your setting for your email address to be private in your user profile. You can also update your local Git configuration to use your private email address.\n\nPlease note that if you would like to compile GitHub data, you must comply with our Terms of Service regarding information usage and privacy, and you may only use any public-facing information you gather for the purpose for which our user authorized it. For example, where a GitHub user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address for the purposes of sending unsolicited emails to users or selling personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards, or for commercial advertising. We expect you to reasonably secure information you have gathered from GitHub, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and ""do not contact"" requests from GitHub or GitHub users.\n\nThird-party applications\nWe share your personal data with third party applications when you tell us to do so. For example, if you purchase an application listed on our Marketplace, we share your username to allow the application developer to provide you with services. You can enable or add third-party applications, known as ""Developer Products,"" to your Account. These Developer Products are not necessary for your use of GitHub. We will share your personal data with such third-party applications when you ask us to; however, you are responsible for your use of the third-party Developer Products and for the amount of personal data you choose to share with it. You can check our API documentation to see what information is provided when you authenticate into a Developer Product using your GitHub profile.\n\nOrganizations with which you engage\nYou may indicate, through your actions on GitHub, that you are willing to share your personal data with Organizations, as defined in GitHub’s Terms of Service, who also use the Services. If you collaborate on or become a member of an Organization, then its Account owners may receive your personal data, for example by having the ability to view your activity in the Organization’s access log.\n\nWhen you accept an invitation to an Organization, you will be notified of the types of information owners may be able to see (for more information, see About Organization Membership). Please contact the Account owners for more information about how they might process your personal data in their Organization and the ways for you to access, update, alter, or delete your personal data stored in the Account.\n\nService providers\nWe share your personal data with service providers who process the information on our behalf to provide or improve our Service. For example, our service providers may perform payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, web analytics, marketing operations, security, online advertising, and other similar services. Our service providers may process data in your region, in the United States, or in any other country where they operate facilities.\n\nSuch processing by service providers and any related cross border data transfers will be in compliance with applicable law.\n\nAffiliates\nWe enable access to personal data across our subsidiaries, affiliates, and related companies, for example, where we share common data systems, when affiliates provide services on our behalf, or where access is needed to operate and provide the Service.\n\nGitHub has the responsibility for the processing of personal information it receives under the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Principles and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on GitHub’s behalf. GitHub shall remain liable under the DPF Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.\n\nFor security purposes\nWe will disclose personal data if we believe it is necessary to:\n\nprotect our customers and others, for example to prevent spam or attempts to commit fraud, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone;\noperate and maintain the security of the Service, including to prevent or stop an attack on our systems or networks; or\nprotect the rights or property or ourselves or others, including enforcing our agreements, terms, and policies.\nFor legal disclosure\nGitHub may disclose personal data or other information we collect about you to law enforcement or other governmental agencies if required in response to a valid legal process. For more information about our disclosure in response to legal requests, see our Guidelines for Legal Requests of User Data.\n\nChange in control or sale\nWe may share your personal data if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition of corporate entities or business units as described in this Privacy Statement.\n\nPlease note that some of the features on our Service include integrations, references, or links to services provided by third parties whose privacy practices differ from ours. If you provide personal data to any of those third parties, or allow us to share personal data with them, that data is governed by their privacy statements.\n\nFinally, we may share de-identified information in accordance with applicable law.",Categories of Personal Information Shared / Disclosed

ra1,"What are cookies and similar technologies?\nWe use cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, local storage, and mobile analytics, to operate and provide our Services. When visiting Enterprise Marketing Pages, like resources.github.com, these and additional cookies, like advertising IDs, may be used for sales and marketing purposes.\n\nCookies are small text files stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.\n\nWeb beacons are electronic images (also called “single-pixel” or “clear GIFs”) that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content.\n\nMobile identifiers for analytics can be accessed and used by apps on mobile devices in much the same way that websites access and use cookies. When visiting Enterprise Marketing pages, like resources.github.com, on a mobile device these may allow us and our third-party analytics and advertising partners to collect data for sales and marketing purposes.\n\nWe may also use so-called “flash cookies” (also known as “Local Shared Objects” or “LSOs”) to collect and store information about your use of our Services. Flash cookies are commonly used for advertisements and videos.",Categories of Personal Information Collected

Some of these cookies and technologies may be provided by third parties, including service providers and advertising partners.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
