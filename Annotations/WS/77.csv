ra3,"WHEN SUBARU SHARES INFORMATION\nSubaru may disclose and share Personal Information and Non-Personal Information in accordance with the practices described in this Privacy Policy. The categories of entities to whom we disclose Personal Information (including in the last 12 months) include the following:\n\nNon-Personal Information\nSubaru may disclose Non-Personal Information about you to Service Providers and other third parties if we deem such disclosure, in our sole discretion, to have sound business reasons or justifications.\n\nWith Your Authorization\n\nWe may disclose Personal Information to provide the Services, or when you authorize or instruct us to do so, for example when you ask us to connect you with a local Retailer.\n\nService Providers\n“Service Providers” are service providers, vendors, and suppliers who provide products and services to Subaru or its Retailers, including in connection with the functionality of the Service. To the extent it is necessary for these entities to provide their products and services to us or to you, these entities may have access to your Personal Information, but they are prohibited by us to use your Personal Information on their own behalf or for any purpose other than providing products and services to us or to you. Subaru may sometimes permit authorized Service Providers to create or access Non-Personal Information in the form of aggregate and anonymized statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related Services information.\n\nEmergency Contacts\nWe may disclose Personal Information to roadside assistance providers, emergency service dispatchers, law enforcement, your designated emergency contacts, or our Affiliates in connection with vehicle-related accidents or other emergencies, or if you report your vehicle stolen.\n\nAffiliates and Distributors\n“Affiliate” means a company directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Subaru.  “Distributor” means a third party with agreements with Subaru Affiliates allowing for the distribution of Subaru branded vehicles by the third party.  Subaru may disclose Personal Information to Affiliates and Distributors and, in some cases, Affiliates and Distributors may use Personal Information for their own benefit, subject to each Affiliate’s or Distributor’s privacy policy.\n\nAPI Providers and Data Providers\n“API Provider” means a third party licensor of software that we include in, or use with, the Services, including an API or SDK, that provides a specialized function or service to us and that requires the transmission of Personal Information and/or Non-Personal Information to the API Provider.\n\n“Data Provider” means a third party provider of data aggregation products and services. We may disclose Personal Information and Non-Personal Information to API Providers and Data Providers and, in some cases, API Providers and Data Providers may use Personal Information and Non-Personal Information for their own benefit.  In such cases, their privacy policies will apply to their use of such Information.\n\nRetailers\nCertain requests or questions that you direct to us are more appropriately answered by a Retailer, such as a request for a price quote on a particular vehicle. In those instances, we will provide your Personal Information, along with your request or question, to a Retailer or Retailers for a response.  We may also disclose Personal Information to a Retailer in connection with product recalls, warranty service or other business purposes in connection with vehicles sold or serviced by a Retailer. The Retailer(s) will have the right to use your Personal Information for purposes of responding to your request, servicing your vehicle, and for its/their own marketing purposes that may not relate to your requests or questions. Retailers’ use of your Personal Information will be subject to the Retailers’ own privacy policies.  Please contact your Retailer for more information, including how to access its privacy policy.\n\nRetailer Service Providers\nWe may partner with third parties to provide services to or on behalf of Retailers (collectively, “Retailer Service Providers”), including collecting Personal Information and Non-Personal Information provided by consumers through co-branded websites that may display Subaru’s logo and trademarks.  These websites are not part of the Services and Subaru is not responsible for and cannot control the privacy practices of other websites or third parties. We encourage you to read the privacy policies for these other websites, as they may differ from ours. Such websites may be identified by the fact that they do not display a Subaru (or Subaru brand) URL, they may have information identifying a third party as the host of the particular website or application, and/or they do not link to this Privacy Policy. Please read the privacy policy on the co-branded website for the applicable privacy practices relating to Personal Information collected via that website, as it may differ from this Privacy Policy.\n\nContests and Promotions\nSubaru occasionally partners with trusted third parties (each, a “Promotions Partner”) for promotions, events, sweepstakes, contests, and other similar activities (collectively, “Promotions”), and may share your Personal Information with such Promotions Partners for Subaru’s marketing purposes and for the Promotions Partners’ own marketing purposes unless you opt out of such sharing by contacting us. The use of your Personal Information by Promotions Partners for their own purposes will be subject to their privacy policies.  The Personal Information we collect from you in connection with Promotions will be used as described in the official rules for that Promotion and may also be used by us for marketing purposes. Certain Promotions may be run by on behalf of Subaru by a Marketing Partner, co-branded with one of our Marketing Partners, or run on a third party website or social media platform, such as Facebook. In these instances a third party, rather than Subaru, may collect your Personal Information. The Promotion will state the policies governing the collection of such Personal Information if they should differ from this Privacy Policy or if a third party will be collecting such Personal Information.\n\nThird Party Marketing\nWe share your Personal Information with third parties (each, a “Third Party Marketer”) for their own marketing purposes from time to time.  For example, we may provide Personal Information to Service Providers to permit them to market services to you for your vehicle (such as for WiFi hotspot or satellite radio services, or insurance or financial products). You may opt out of this sharing by contacting us.\n\nMergers, Acquisitions, and Insolvency\nIf Subaru should ever file for bankruptcy or merge with another company, or if Subaru should decide to buy, sell, or reorganize some part or all of its business, Subaru may disclose your Personal Information, including to prospective or actual purchasers in connection with one of these transactions.\n\nAs Required by Law and Other Extraordinary Disclosures\nSubaru may be required to disclose your Personal Information, including location data, if it: (i) believes it is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, etc.) or other legal or regulatory requirements or requests of any governmental authority, (ii) would potentially mitigate our liability in an actual or potential lawsuit or investigation, (iii) is necessary to protect our rights or property or enforce our contracts,  (iv) is necessary to protect the legal rights, safety or property of others, (v) will prevent, solve or prosecute a crime, or protect national security, or (vi) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.",Categories of Personal Information Shared / Disclosed
