We obtain a variety of information (collectively the “Information”) from trusted third-party data providers such as mobile application developers.

WE COLLECT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION FROM THESE APPS

Mobile ad identifiers, primarily Apple iOS IDFAs or Google Android IDs;

The horizontal accuracy of the latitude/longitude coordinates.

The precise geographic location of a device at a certain time, usually expressed in latitude/longitude coordinates along with a timestamp;

In addition to the above we may also receive

Information about a device such as device type and model and OS type and version;

Public facing (external) IP address of device;

The direction in which the device is traveling as a degree coordinate and speed of device;

Altitude and vertical accuracy;

Phone carrier and connection type (e.g., cellular, wifi);

Proximity beacon UUID’s or any associated Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) beacon metadata.

Device language;

Available or connected WiFi SSID and/or BSSID names;

We also collect certain Information when people visit our website(s), including the website on which this Privacy Policy resides. When you visit our website, we or third party platforms we work with may automatically collect other information from your desktop computer, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device that you use to access the website.

ra3,"HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Inferences from Aggregated Data. We often use the information we collect to make inferences about human location and traffic patterns. We curate these insights into data products. We may append other fields such as venue name, category, dwell timed or ticker symbols to an aggregate group of device IDs to build consumer profiles or to make financial based decisions such as trading on the stock market based off our aggregate panel. IDs.""

Aggregated Traffic Patterns and Research. We also share the information we receive with other marketing and research companies (including advertising platforms), who use the information to provide similar services. This helps these companies to better predict and draw insights about consumer, market or scientific trends related to human movement patterns. This same information may also be licensed to real estate, city planners or smart city companies and augmented with fields to create more specific segments. For example if an aggregate group of devices drive vs walk to determine whether to put a bus stop in an area or not or to understand the flow of traffic overtime to determine whether to purchase or not purchase a piece of real estate.

The above is not an exhaustive description of all of the ways the information we collect may be used:  we may, for instance, sometimes customize uses of the information we have for certain customers. But the above does describe the types of information that we collect, how we generally collect it, and what our company focuses on.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
