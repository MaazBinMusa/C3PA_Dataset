We use the information gathered in the same manner as described above for our licensed software products (with the addition that we may use your contact details to respond to any queries that you may have).\n\nCareer Coach is a collaborative tool that brings or may bring together four separate parties to make the most of the tool. First, when you use the Career Coach tool, you are an End User of the tool and any of its associated customer services. Second, Lightcast is the company that produces the Career Coach tool and hosts it on secure web servers. When you are using the Career Coach tool, you are interacting with software that runs on Lightcast servers. Third, an organization, such as a university or private company (“the Organization”) has contracted with Lightcast for Lightcast to make Career Coach accessible in a customized format. As part Lightcast's contract with the Organization, Lightcast agrees to provide the Organization with aggregated, depersonalized demographic information gathered through the Career Coach tool. This allows the Organization to adapt to better meet the needs of its constituents. Lightcast has also agreed to provide the Organization with your personal information, when you – the End User – register on Career Coach. Fourth, third parties who provide services that are essential to delivering the Career Coach may receive information that is entered into Career Coach. These Third Parties include companies who provide internet transmission and hosting services. Lightcast may also from time-to-time make available aggregated, de-personalized demographic information, which is gathered through the Career Coach tool, to other third parties.
