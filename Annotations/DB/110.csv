We also may obtain data through public sources, such as census data and other public records. Some of the data we receive, use and make available is Personal Information (“PI”) or is linked to PI. PI includes, for instance, name, postal address, telephone number or email address. In addition, some of our services involve using and making available “business to business” (“B2B”) data, which is obtained from a number of sources, including public directories, filings and publications, surveys and subscriptions.\n\nWe also collect certain information when you visit our website, https://www.data-axle.com, as described in the below section titled “Data Collected On Our Website.”",Categories of Personal Information Collected
