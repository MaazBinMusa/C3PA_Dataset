This information may or may not constitute “personal information” or “personal data” under various Data Protection and Privacy Laws, depending on the context in which the information is collected and any other information to which is linked or linkable.

Pseudonymous IDs
Pseudonymous IDs include cookies, mobile advertising IDs or MAIDs, TV advertising identifiers, hashed email addresses, IP addresses, or other alpha-numeric identifiers that are provided by our business clients or partners from which we license data, that do not, by themselves, identify a specific individual. To protect privacy, we segregate Direct Identifiers from Pseudonymous IDs, and we use technical and organizational measures to maintain that separation and prevent unauthorized identification of individuals.

Direct Identifiers
Direct Identifiers include information that relates specifically to an individual such as the individual’s name, government identification number or code, telephone number, or e-mail address. 

Currently, Lotame only collects, uses, and discloses e-mail addresses when provided by our business clients or data licensees. When Lotame does receive e-mail addresses, to protect privacy, we tokenize e-mail addresses, segregate e-mail addresses from Pseudonymous IDs, and use technical and organizational measures and controls to maintain that separation and prevent unauthorized identification of individuals using e-mail addresses. 

Attribute Information
Attribute Information includes attributes, behaviors, preferences, interests, and other characteristics of an individual or inferred about an individual based on that individual’s location, intent data, socio-demographic data, purchase data, browsing, survey data, and other data that corresponds to a particular use of or visit to a website or application by that individual.

Non-Precision Geolocation Data
Non-precise Geolocation Data means data that approximates location, such as postal code/zip code.  

Log Data, including Internet Log Data, and Event Data
Internet Log Data includes data that is automatically sent by an individual’s browser or device in order to communicate with servers, such as the URL of the page requested, IP Address, browser or device type, language, operating system information, mobile service provider, date, and time stamps.

Event Data includes data about ads an individual sees (advertiser ID, campaign ID), where and when the individual sees the ad (date/time stamp, URL), and how the individual reacts to the ads (click, hover, convert, etc.).",Categories of Personal Information Shared / Disclosed
