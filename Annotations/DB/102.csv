ra3,"What Information is Collected About You\nThe information we may collect about you (“Personal Information”) encompasses a variety of categories. Personal Information is information that identifies you, describes you, relates to you, or can be reasonably linked to you. It includes information that can be directly associated with a specific person, entity, or device such as a name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or IP address. It also includes information about activities that are directly linked to that person, entity, or device. All information we collect from you on/via/through our Website or from our third-party partners or affiliates is defined under “Personal Information”.\n\n \n\nII: From Where, When, and What Specific Personal Information is Collected\nAutomatic Collection. We automatically receive certain types of Personal Information whenever you interact with us online. For example, when you visit our Website, our systems automatically collect your IP address, physical location, the type of browser you use, the type of computer you are using, computer operating system, type of mobile device and carrier (if applicable), and where you navigated from to reach our Website. \nInformation You Provide. We also collect Personal Information you provide us when you contact us through our Website or when you create an account on our Website. The Personal Information we gather through this would vary, depending on what Personal Information you elect to give us, but the information collected would be identifiers: information identifying you, such as your email, name, phone number, political affiliation, past donor history, past voting history, . \nCookies. Personal Information may be automatically collected through the use of “Cookies” or cookie-like files called “Local Shared Objects” (also known as Flash cookies).\nMost browsers are set to accept cookies by default. By continuing to use our Website, you are accepting and consenting to our use of cookies, however you are free to adjust your browser settings to reject cookies and/or actually delete cookies, at your own volition. However, doing either could affect certain features or services on our website. Note that browser settings may not affect Local Shared Objects. \n \nIII: Why do we collect Personal Information?\nIt helps us optimize the features of our Website and improve your experience. We use Cookies and Local Shared Objects to help us improve your experience, via saving account information so that you don’t have to re-log in all the time, or through saving any preferences you have specified in using the Website. \nIt helps us get a better sense of who accesses our Website and who uses its features. As a data-intensive company, we love monitoring and analyzing data. In this case, the information we may collect could help us understand more about who is using and accessing our Website, which helps us understand more about our audience and the effectiveness of our outreach practices and technologies. Cookies let us count new visitors who come to our Website, giving us a more reliable sense of the traffic our website receives, and IP addresses let us know the general areas from which these visitors come – crucial to understanding the geographic scope of our outreach practices and technologies. \nIt allows us to communicate with you. Collecting your Personal Information permits us to respond to you if you contact us, or to reach out to you if we want or need to contact you. If we do not have your email/phone number/name, then we cannot contact you, which would be problematic if we needed to, especially if we needed to respond to a question you had posed. ",Categories of Personal Information Collected

Note that following your request, but before we conduct any action, we will need to authenticate you as being who you say you are. If we cannot authenticate you, we will not conduct your request.
