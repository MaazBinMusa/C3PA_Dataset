In order to provide our Services, we receive data, including personal information, from a variety of sources, including from websites and apps that collect the information, public sources, and other data compilers.   We refer to the information that we collect and process throughout this Privacy Policy  as “Information” or “the Information.”

The Information often includes various contact information, such as name, address, email address and telephone number.  It also includes demographic information about individuals.   It may also include information (on the individual, household, or wider (e.g., zip code) level), such as:

Professional information, including occupation and job title or job history,
Particular interests, such as (for instance) home improvement, music, online shopping, health and beauty sport, or travel, or political leanings,
Demographic information, such as gender, age or age range, level of education or likely income range.
Geolocation information, such as location coordinates tied to a device or wifi identifier.
Online identifiers (such as cookie or mobile ad IDs), and IP addresses
This type of information may be inferred – for instance, if a household is in a particularly wealthy area, we might infer a particular income range.   

Anteriad also receives information through this website (and any other website we operate), and through corporate interactions and events.   We describe this information in Section 6.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
ra2,"2. How We Use the Information
Anteriad uses the Information for a range of purposes, including the following:

As Part of Our Services:
Data Marketing Services.  Our Services include providing marketing information to our customers, generally regarding which customers or prospective customers are most likely to be interested (or disinterested) in certain offers.   When we provide these Services, consumers may be identified (and their information shared) in various ways, such as by household, email address, or device identifier. Similarly, we help our customers identify and understand their customers better, by providing insights about them.  
Online Targeting.  We sometimes create defined audience segments (“Audience Segments”) based on common demographics and/or shared (actual or inferred) interests or preferences (e.g., households with tech professionals, or with an interest in winter travel).  When we do this, we may work with a data partner that  “matches” our Information through de-identification techniques (such as through coded data “hashing”) with online cookies and other identifiers, in order to target and measure ad campaigns online across various display, mobile and other media channels.  You may learn more about how to opt out of this and other online ad targeting in Section 4.
Email Targeting.  We use the infrastructure and technology of either our Customers or our own service providers to help our Customers send and target (and measure and analyze) their email campaigns.
Additional Marketing Services.  Other Services we may sometimes provide to our customers (or that they may provide to their own customers), which may overlap with or supplement the above, may involve (a) help with targeting and optimizing direct mail, email campaigns, display, social and mobile marketing; (b) measuring how effective marketing campaigns have been, by determining which messages are most likely to be seen or opened by which types of consumers, or which types of ads are most likely to lead to purchases; (c) analyzing and optimizing our customers’ (or their service providers’) proprietary databases or (d) providing “validation” or data “hygiene” services, which is how companies update and/or correct their databases by verifying or removing or correcting old, incorrect or outdated information.
To Operate Our Services.  We also use the Information for our own internal purposes – such as to improve, test, update and verify our own database; develop new products;  operate, analyze, improve and secure our Services and our databases and servers.",Categories of Personal Information Sold

With Our Customers:  Our customers include (but are not limited to) brands and agencies and various marketing data platforms that help them to market and advertise to their own customers (and prospective customers); our customers also include other data compilers, who work with their own customers. We license the Information in various ways to our customers (and something to partners and resellers, who license the Information to their customer), when we provide our Services. We may sometimes share the Information with those Customers’ service providers (for instance, a provider that prints or sends mailings or email for a Customer).

With Our Partners:  We may also share the Information, including personally identifiable information (such as contact information) and Audience Segments, with business and data partners to help to tailor marketing and advertising campaigns and other communications.  Likewise, we may share the information with those partners for analytical purposes, including to help those parties measure campaign performance, inform future campaigns, or to handle, analyze, or segregate this Information – generally on our or our customers’ behalf, but sometimes to help those parties’ own customers.
With Our Service Providers:  We share the Information with a variety of service providers in order to operate, protect and advertise our Services and maintain our website(s).  For instance, we may share the Information with hosting providers, tech and customer support providers, marketing and advertising solution vendors, other data providers (such as to enhance or verify our Information), security providers, billing and payment vendors (as to our business to business information), and other companies that help us operate, improve or develop the Services.
Corporate transfers:  If Anteriad, its stock or its significant assets are acquired by or merged into another entity, our information will be transferred to that entity, and may be shared during due diligence in anticipation of any such transaction.
As required by law or to protect any person or entity:  Anteriad may disclose Information if we believe that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply in good faith with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect or otherwise defend the rights, property or safety of Anteriad, our customers, or any other person or entity.",Categories of Personal Information Shared / Disclosed
ra2,"4. Your Marketing and Opt-Out Choices
There are multiple ways that you can opt-out of having the Information used to market to you:

First, you may contact us directly to have your personal information removed from our database via our website privacy portal located at Form.  When you do this, please provide your current address, your email address, and any prior home or email addresses you would like “opted out” of our marketing databases.   Or if you prefer, you can contact us directly by Email or mail, at:
Attn:  Privacy

Anteriad, LLC

2 International Drive, Suite 300,

Rye Brook, NY 10573, USA

Email: privacy@Anteriad.com

We will then in most cases remove your personal information from our active marketing databases within 30 business days, from the time we received the opt-out request.  We may in certain cases (but not in most cases) require that you verify any of the information that you submit, such as through a verified email response or another verified response.

If you would like to opt-out of direct mail advertising in general, we recommend that you visit the DMA Choice website, at dmachoice.thedma.org. The DMA Choice service is run by the Direct Marketing Association and allows you to follow few easy steps to ensure that your marketing preferences are honored. 
If you wish to opt out of online targeted ads (sometimes referred to as “interest-based” or “personalized” advertising), you can also visit the opt-out portals operated the industry groups the National Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), and you can learn more about how those opt-outs work on those linked web pages.  Please note that these online opt-outs are cookie-based (unlike Anteriad’s direct opt-out.  Thus, if you browse the web from multiple browsers or devices, you will need to opt out from each browser and/or device, and for the same reason, if you change browsers or clear your browser cookie cache, you will need to perform this opt-out function again.  Opting-out in this way will not prevent you from seeing all types of online ads; it generally will prevent targeted ads customized to what advertisers think may be most likely to be relevant and of interest to you.
If we market to you by email, in our corporate capacity – such as if you are a customer or prospective customer of ours and we send information about our Services — you may “unsubscribe” from our marketing emails through a link placed in your emails.",Methods to exercise rights

Cookies and How We Use Them
Anteriad its business partners use certain industry-standard technologies, including cookies and similarly functioning technologies, which we describe below. (We and/or our service providers use these technologies on our website, for instance, and our partners may use these technologies in their own marketing services.)

We may work with third parties or service providers to provide or enhance our services (e.g. for purposes of tailoring ads, or placing browser cookies), or to offer marketers ways to access or use our Information, often in de-identified form.   These partners may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your device, which may have cookies with varying expiration periods. Those partners may, likewise, collect various types of information about your browser, device, or browsing activities through use of these cookies.

Cookies, in turn, are small data files that contain a string of characters, such as a  unique browser identifier. Cookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as tags that identify your device. Our (or other companies’) servers send your device a cookie when you visit a website. A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages.  When you access web pages (such as the website of a marketer), pixel tags may generate a generic notice of the visit and permit our partners (or sometimes, us) to read the cookies that a respective company or server has deployed.  Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to track the activity on a site by a particular device.  When you turn off cookies, pixel tags simply detect a given  website visit.

We or our service providers, and other online marketing platforms that we or they work with, may use cookies to, among other things, “remember” you, determine visitor patterns and trends, collect information about your activities on our clients’ sites, or interact with the advertising you see.   Cookies are used in this way to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant communications with ads that better match your interests.

Sometimes, we work with companies that link our Audience Segments to cookies (as also described in Section 2), in order to help companies better target (or suppress) advertisements to consumers.   This is one of type of the various categories of advertising that are often referred to as “personalized” or “interest-based” advertising” or “Interest-Based Advertising.”   You can opt out of this type of advertising through the industry opt-out methods described in Section 3, which are cookie-based.",Categories of Personal Information Collected

ra2,"12. The GDPR and Your Choices and Access Rights With Respect to Personal Data
If you are a resident of one of many European countries, including the United Kingdom, an important European privacy law (or an equivalent counterpart) the General Data Privacy Regulation (the “GDPR”) provides you with certain rights, and places certain obligations on companies, regarding how your “personal data” (as the GDPR uses that term) is used.  We describe those rights and obligations below, and how and in what circumstances we honor them.  (Please only rely on this Section 11 if you are in fact a resident of such a country – it will not apply otherwise.)

Legal Basis. The GDPR requires us to tell you about the legal ground we’re relying on to process any “personal data” (as the GDPR uses that term) about you. The legal grounds for us processing your personal data for the purposes set out in Section 2 above will typically be because:

You provided your (legally sufficient) consent;
It is necessary for our contractual relationship, e.g., in order to provide you services or features you’ve requested and we’ve promised;
The processing is necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations – for instance, to communicate with you about or to help honor your legal rights; and/or
The processing is in our legitimate interest. For instance, we may process and share business data (such as a person’s business email or address and job title) in order to assist our customers to send relevant business-related communications. (As an example, if you are a technology attorney, we might help a privacy foundation or legal association send you an invitation to a privacy law conference by providing or validating for them your most recent contact information.)   
Your rights. Your rights to access, correct, delete or withdraw consent. right to request access to a copy of your personal data, or request that we correct or “rectify,” restrict or delete Your personal data, You may exercise these rights by contacting us at privacy@Anteriad.com or through our website privacy portal located at Form. If you request that we delete your personal data, or withdraw your consent, we will customarily retain a copy of your data sufficient to suppress it from our active databases in the future:  but if that is not what you wish, you may indicate that to us (in which case your information may be added to our database later, because we will not have “suppressed” it).

Moreover, when we delete your personal data, we may retain it (to the extent legal permissible) for certain important (but narrow) internal purposes such as legal, compliance, accounting or auditing purposes. Likewise, when you request access to your information, we are required — for privacy and other important compliance reasons — to verify your identity in a legally sufficient manner: if we cannot do so, we will not be able to satisfy your access request.

Personalized Online Advertising Opt Outs has been amended to the following: Personalized Online Advertising Opt-Outs. You may object to profiling by online advertising platforms with whom we sometimes partner to help generate (and measure or analyze) “personalized” online advertising.

Questions or Concerns.  If you have a complaint or concern or question about how we handle your personal data, please contact us as at the above contact addresses, and we will seek to address any concerns you may have.  If you are not happy with how we have attempted to resolve your complaint, you may contact the relevant data protection authority.

When We are a Processor. EU data protection law makes a distinction between organisations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “data controllers”) and organisations that process personal data on behalf of other organisations (known as “data processors”).   Anteriad sometimes acts as a data controller (for instance, when we make decisions about the data that comprises our own datasets) and sometimes acts as a processor (for instance, when we ingest information that belongs to a customer, such as a “CRM” file that we help analyze).   We generally are only able to help data subjects exercise their rights as to data we are a data controller of.   If you have a question or request as to data we’re a processor of, you should generally address that to the relevant data controller.

Since the requirements for compliance with Privacy Shield vary depending on whether we are acting as a Processor on behalf of our clients or as a Controller, our policies and manner of compliance are described separately below.

The practices we employ under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, as outlined also apply to data transferred from Switzerland to the United States in compliance with the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework. Anteriad will adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to data transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Principles for as long as it retains such data.

Purposes of Data Processing
Anteriad acts as a data processor with respect to Personal Data we receive from our clients and process such information only under the instruction of our clients and are controlled by our clients in the EU, the UK and/or Switzerland. In this capacity, we do not own or control any of the information we process on behalf of our clients. All such information is owned and controlled by our clients. In this capacity, we receive information transferred from the EU, the UK and Switzerland to the United States merely as a Processor on behalf of our clients.

Before starting any processing on behalf of our clients, we enter into a processing contract with the Controller that ensures the Controller is in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulations (“GDPR”) or Member State Data Protection law that may apply. The processing contract will also specify that the processing will be carried out with appropriate data security measures. We have measures in place designed to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

Any data processed by us will not be further disclosed to third parties except where permitted or required by the processing contract, Privacy Shield, GDPR, or the applicable Member State Data Protection law. Any information our client (acting as the Controller) identifies as sensitive, will be treated accordingly.

When Anteriad provides business and consumer information products, we act as a Controller of the Personal Data contained in the information products. As a Controller, we share Personal Data with third parties that fall into various categories: clients, vendors and partners. Our clients include but not limited to financial, retail, insurance, and automotive companies.  Our vendors include data suppliers and service providers. We also share Personal Data with partners such as other data resellers for marketing purposes. When we act as a Controller of Personal Data, the policies outlined apply to all Personal Data that has been transferred from the EU, the UK or Switzerland to the United States.

Anteriad and its affiliates located in the EU, the UK or Switzerland, develop and maintain Personal Data on data subjects, households, and businesses located throughout EU Member States, the UK or Switzerland. This information is obtained from public records, publicly available information, information acquired through information providers, and information collected directly from data subjects.

This information is provided to qualified businesses for marketing, customer data integration, and connectivity purposes. This information may also be used to provide information services, enhance the understanding a company has about its customers, aid in accurate integration of a company’s customer information, and be used as lists for direct marketing purposes.

Notice
We may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including requests to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Prior to the transfer of Personal Data from the EU, the UK or Switzerland to the United States, we require contractual confirmation from the Controller from whom we acquired the information that the Personal Data has been provided to us in accordance with GDPR, Privacy Shield, or the applicable EU Member State Data Protection law, thereby ensuring the data subjects have been provided with proper notice regarding how their Personal Data will be used. In addition, when Personal Data is collected directly from data subjects, we provide the data subject with notice regarding the manner and circumstances in which the Personal Data will be used and transferred to third parties.

Choice
We provide choices and means for individuals to limit the use of their Personal Data. In addition to providing individuals with choices regarding our use of their information, we will remove an individual’s name and related information from our direct marketing information products if they request it. Consumers may request an opt-out form by writing Anteriad at the address below, sending an e-mail to us at privacy@Anteriad.com or via a Form.

Onward Transfer
Since we share Personal Data with third parties as referenced above, we comply with the notice and choice principles as described above for all data disclosed or transferred to a third party. We take reasonable and appropriate steps designed to ensure that the third party effectively processes the Personal Data transferred in a manner consistent with our obligations under the Principles.

When we use data processors to perform processing tasks on our behalf and at our direction and instruction, we require our data processors either:

Subscribe to the Privacy Shield (in the case of US-based processors), comply with the General Data Protection Regulations (in the case of EU, UK or Switzerland -based processors), or another adequacy finding (in the case of processors in countries outside the US, EU, UK, or Switzerland); or
Enter into a written agreement with us requiring the data processor(s) to process the data only for limited and specified purposes and to provide the same level of protection as Anteriad
In cases of onward transfer to third parties, we may be liable for the acts of the third party that are in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles.",Others

Generally speaking, we collect and share the Personal Information that we collect for the following purposes, as we also have described in our Privacy Policy and/or our website.

Our Purposes for collecting, using and sharing Personal Information
Data marketing services, for example:

Generally, creating data marketing tools and products for our marketer clients, as more fully described in our Privacy Policy (and on our websites).   This includes our provision of datasets, data “appends” (connecting data across datasets), data “scoring” (providing inferences about potential consumer behavior), data hygiene services (helping customers to evaluate, validate and correct personal information they hold), and security and anti-fraud services (helping customers to identify potentially fraudulent activity).
Helping our Clients identify and understand their consumers better, by providing insights about them and managing loyalty programs, as well as providing financial and other scoring products.
Assisting our Clients through our Services to provide their current and prospective customers with better service, improved offerings, and special promotions, for instance, advising on which current or prospective customers are most likely to be interested (or disinterested) in certain offers.
Online targeting, for example:

Creating or helping to create defined audience segments based on common demographics and/or shared (actual or inferred) interests or preferences (e.g., households with prospective students). When we do this, we work with a data partner that “matches” our or other Information through de-identification techniques (such as through coded data “hashing”) with online cookies and other identifiers, in order to target and measure ad campaigns online across various display, mobile and other media channels.
Assisting Clients in creating “identity” graphs, to help locate users across various channels, such as based on common personal, device-based, or network-based identifiers (e.g., IP address, email address).
Additional marketing services, for example (which may overlap with “data marketing services” above):

Assisting in targeting and optimizing of direct mail and email campaigns, display, mobile and social media marketing.
Measuring the effectiveness of online or offline ad campaigns by determining which messages are most likely to be seen or opened by which types of consumers, or which types of ads are most likely to lead to purchases.

California residents have the right to request that we disclose what categories of your personal information that we collect, use, or sell.  As explained in Section (D) below, you may also request the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected from you.  (We may withhold some personal information where the risks are too great to permit disclosure of the information.)",Description of Right to Know PI Collected
ra2,"C. Right to request deletion of your personal information
As explained further in Section (D) below, you may also request that we delete any personal information that we collected from , such as if you have been a customer of ours.  (Note that this is different from your right to “opt out” of us selling your personal information, which is described below; also note that we do not generally collect personal information directly from consumers.)  However, we may retain personal information for certain important purposes, such as (a) to protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality (such as de-bugging purposes), (c) as necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) to comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.  Additionally, we need certain types of information so that we can provide our Services to you.  If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use our Services.",Description of Right to Delete
ra2,"D. How to exercise your access, and (if applicable) deletion rights
Access:  California residents may exercise their California privacy rights by sending an email to privacy@Anteriad.com, submitting their removal request through our form, or by contacting us at 1-800 368 7602.

Because it is required by California law (and also, for security purposes), we will verify your identity – in part by requesting certain information from you or by requesting you demonstrate possession of a particular identification method (such as an email account) — when you request to exercise your California privacy rights.  For instance, if you request categories or specific pieces of personal information we have received about you, you may need to confirm your possession of such an identifier (such as an email address) or to provide a piece of identification that confirms you are the person you claim to be.

Once we have verified your identity, we will respond to your request as appropriate:

Where you have requested the categories of personal information that we have collected about you, we will provide a list of those categories.
Where you have requested specific pieces of personal information, we will provide the information you have requested, to the extent required under the CCPA and provided we do not believe there is an overriding privacy or security concern to doing so.
Deletion:  Where you have requested that we delete personal information that we have collected from you, we will seek to confirm whether your request is for an “opt out” or a “deletion”: because “opt out” or “do not sell” rights enable us to maintain your information for “suppression” purposes – i.e., to prevent us from selling information about you in the future (which is what many consumers requesting “deletion” actually desire to occur), we try to explain this in order to ensure we are meeting consumers’ preferences.  (In addition, “deletion” rights only apply to information that we have collected “from” consumers – which does not apply to much of the information in our databases.)",Methods to exercise rights
