Sensors:
To determine your ability to receive HTML-based e-mail messages, Acxiom may include a coded sensor in its HTML-based e-mail messages. The sensor activates when the e-mail message is opened and flags the e-mail address of the recipient as one that is capable of receiving HTML-based e-mail messages. This capability helps us to send the e-mail in a format you can read, which allows us to track the aggregate number of e-mails read and to measure, in aggregate, if any of the links in the e-mail were accessed. If the recipient cannot receive HTML e-mails, the recipient will not receive a functioning sensor.
