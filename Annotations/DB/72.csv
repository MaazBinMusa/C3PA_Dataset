We also help our customers identify and understand their customers better, by providing insights about them. Our customers include (but are not limited to) small and medium-sized businesses, ad and media agencies, brands and marketing data platforms that help their customers to market and advertise to their own customers (and prospective customers). Our customers also may include other data compilers, who work with their own customers.
Retargeting Services.  We sometimes help our customers to “retarget” marketing content to website visitors. In particular, our Services help customers send emails to people who visited or logged in to their websites by cross-referencing information such as cookie identifiers and emails for those purposes. 
Additional Marketing Services. Other Services we may provide to our customers (or help them to provide to their own customers), which may supplement the above Services, may involve (a) assisting customers to target and optimize email campaigns, display, or other marketing; (b) measuring how effective marketing campaigns have been, by determining which messages are most likely to be seen or opened by which types of consumers, or which types of ads are most likely to lead to purchases; (c) analyzing and optimizing our customers’ (or their service providers’) proprietary databases; (d) helping customers to detect and prevent fraud and provide “validation” or data hygiene services, e.g., by verifying or removing or correcting old, incorrect or outdated information or evaluating whether an email address recently has been active.",Categories of Personal Information Collected

Corporate transfers: If Retention.com, its stock or its significant assets are acquired by or merged into another entity, our information will be transferred to that entity, and may be shared during due diligence in anticipation of any such transaction.

ra1,"There are multiple ways that you can opt-out of having the Information used to market to you:

First, you may visit our opt-out page at https://app.retention.com/optout to have your personal information removed from our database. We will then in most cases remove your personal information from our active marketing databases within 15 business days, from the time we received the opt-out request. We may in certain cases (and where legally permissible) require that you verify any of the information that you submit, such as through a verified email response or another verified response.
If you would like to opt-out of email marketing from a particular brand (such as a customer of ours), click on the “opt out” or “unsubscribe” link in the footer (at the bottom) of the marketing email you have received.
While we generally do not engage in “direct mail” marketing, some of our customers and partners may. If you are interested in opting our of this type of marketing — i.e., materials received in your physical mailbox — we recommend that you visit the DMA Choice website, at thedma.org. The DMA Choice service is run by the Direct Marketing Association and allows you to follow few easy steps to ensure that your marketing preferences are honored. 
To opt out of our Retargeting Services described in section 2, go to and click on the “Opt Out” bar on that page. You will need to do that from each browser that you use (because the retargeting and thus the “opt out” are cookie-based), and if you clear your browser cookies you will need to opt out again.
If we market to you by email in our corporate capacity — such as if you are a customer or prospective customer of ours and we send information about our Services — you may “unsubscribe” from our marketing emails through a link placed in your emails.",Methods to exercise rights

Generally speaking, we collect and share the Personal Information that we collect for the following purposes, as we also have described in our Privacy Policy and/or our website. 

Our Purposes for collecting, using and sharing Personal Information

Data marketing services, for example:

Generally, creating data marketing tools and products for our marketer clients, as more fully described in our Privacy Policy (and on our websites).   This includes our provision of datasets, data “appends” (connecting data across datasets), data “scoring” (providing inferences about potential identifiers), data hygiene services (helping customers to evaluate, validate and correct personal information they hold), and security and anti-fraud services (helping customers to identify potentially fraudulent activity).
Helping our Clients identify and understand their consumers better, by providing insights about them and managing loyalty programs, as well as providing financial and other scoring products.
Assisting our Clients through our Services to provide their current and prospective customers with better service, generally related to the above.
 

Creating “identity” graphs or associations between data points, to help locate users across various channels, such as based on common personal, device-based, or network-based identifiers (e.g., IP address, cookie or device identifiers, email address).
 

Additional marketing services, for example (which may overlap with “data marketing services” above):

Assisting in targeting and optimizing of direct mail and email campaigns, display, mobile, and social media marketing.
Measuring the effectiveness of online or offline ad campaigns by determining which messages are most likely to be seen or opened by which types of consumers, or which types of ads are most likely to lead to purchases.
Analyzing and optimizing our Clients’ (or their service providers’) proprietary databases, or helping Clients to identify and mitigate potential fraud.
Providing “hygiene” or “verification” services, which is how companies update and/or “clean” their databases by either verifying or removing or correcting old, incorrect, or outdated information.
 

Operating our Services, for example: 

Testing, improving, updating and verifying our own database.
Developing new products.
Operating, analyzing, improving, and securing our Services.
 Other internal purposes, for example:

For internal operations, auditing, research, detecting security incidents, debugging, short-term and transient use, quality control, and legal compliance.
