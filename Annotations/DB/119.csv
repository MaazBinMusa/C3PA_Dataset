Where this is the case, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.\n\nIf a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of access, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.\n\nRight to Rectification\n\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.\n\nIf a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.\n\nRight to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)\n\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary: The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.\n\nThe personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed. The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing. The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR. The personal data have been unlawfully processed. The personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject. The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) of the GDPR.\n\nIf one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to request the erasure of personal data stored by Roq.ad, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller. An employee of Roq.ad shall promptly ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately.\n\nWhere the controller has made personal data public and is obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other controllers processing the personal data that the data subject has requested erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data, as far as processing is not required. An employees of Roq.ad will arrange the necessary measures in individual cases.\n\nRight of Restriction of Processing\n\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies. The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data. The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of their use instead. The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.\n\nIf one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal data stored by Roq.ad, he or she may at any time contact any employee of the controller. The employee of Roq.ad will arrange the restriction of the processing.\n\nRight to Data Portability\n\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator, to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which was provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.

This also applies to profiling based on these provisions.\n\nRoq.ad shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\n\nIf Roq.ad processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing.
