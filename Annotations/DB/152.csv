We use the information we acquire to deliver ads to the most relevant recipients.

For example, if you are a student, we may deliver ads for school course offerings or financial aid. Segments may be based on demographic characteristics such as age and gender, geographic area, and other categories derived from various information. We also collect and maintain health-related data segments to allow our clients to provide these kinds of tailored advertising services to end users. Any health-related data segments used for targeting will not include sensitive health information, such as your actual diagnosis for a particular condition or any of your past online behavior with respect to conditions like cancer or mental health disorders.

We may engage in IBA (or online behavioral advertising, “OBA”). This may utilize the segments referred to above, and end user data derived from browsing habits on the Internet, to target specific ads to individuals. For example, if an advertiser wants us to display ads to individuals who have expressed interest in acne, sun-care products, or advances in treating certain medical conditions, we may serve ads for those products or services to those individuals based on segment data and Internet browsing habits. We may also serve ads to you based on inferences we have made regarding health-related information that may be of interest to you. We may make these inferences using models based on a sample set of other users’ health records, which we then compare with information in our databases to create datasets we can use to make certain predictions or inferences regarding characteristics that may apply to you, including the likelihood of the existence of certain medical conditions. The purpose of such advertising is to serve ads better related to products and services that may be relevant to the interests of the individuals seeing them",Categories of Personal Information Collected

‍We use the information we acquire to deliver ads to the most relevant recipients. For example, we may use PII and Non-PII to develop audience segments, or groupings of individuals with common interests or characteristics, and deliver ads to the individuals within a segment, or to the websites frequented by users of a particular segment, that we determine are relevant to that segment. So, for example, if you are a student, we may deliver ads for school course offerings or financial aid.

Segments may be based on demographic characteristics such as age and gender, geographic area, and other categories derived from various information, including purchasing tendencies. Segments may also be based on certain medical conditions, such as flu or diabetes, or other medical conditions that are considered sensitive, such as cancer. Here are the health segments we use:

‍We may serve ads to you based on your previous visits to a website or clicks on an ad.

In some instances, a cookie is placed on your computer while at the advertiser’s site, and when that cookie is seen by us on the website of another company in our Platform, we will deliver the advertiser’s ad there.

ra5,"‍Geo-Fencing

‍We or our service providers may deliver ads to your mobile device when you are in certain geographic locations. This type of targeted advertising is referred to as “geo-fencing” or “geo-targeting.” Geo-fencing works by placing a “fence” around a certain geographic (“geo”) location.  For example, we or one of our service providers could create a 2 square mile “fence” around a grocery store. When you go inside that fence or target area, we or our service providers may serve you specific ads based on you being in that target area. In the case of the grocery store example, you may, for example, be served ads about the grocery store or a product sold in that grocery store.  

With geo-fencing we do not continuously, periodically, or intermittently track your precise location.  The geo location of your device will, however, be provided to us or one of our service partners when you enter the target area, and we may also be provided other Non-PII. Geo-fencing monitors an area and sends notifications either to an app you have on your mobile device or directly to us or our service providers when the boundary is crossed, either in or out. Those apps use this location information to process status updates only if you have geo-location enabled on your mobile device. We will not target you with ads based on your geo-location unless we believe you have provided consent to do so.  

If you want to limit or prevent location data from being collected from your device you can adjust this capability through your mobile device settings. Please refer to your applicable device settings for instructions on how to manage your location settings. Additional options for opting out of receiving targeted ads can be found in the “Consumer Choice” section below.",Others

ra5,"Consumer/User Choice and Opt Out
We are committed to following the NAI’s Code of Conduct and complying with the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising, which encourage consumer choice.

If you are a California resident, or provide us with the Personal Information of a California resident please see the following additional terms:

You may Opt Out at DO NOT SELL MY INFORMATION. See below and the HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION section and disclosures in this Privacy. 

You may opt-out of our Platform for IBA/OBA. Opting out does not prevent you from seeing ads; it simply means that we will no longer collect data for the purpose of IBA/OBA, and you will no longer receive ads based on your historical viewing interests, personal characteristics, consumer segments, or other information. You may still receive contextual ads, as described above.

We encourage advertisers that place ads through our Platform that are delivered for IBA/OBA to display the DAA’s YourAdChoices Icon, which contains a link consumers may click to understand how their data is being used and see the choices they have to control the collection of data online and the display of ads for IBA/OBA. The DAA offers an opt-out tool to opt-out of the collection of data online and the display of ads for IBA/OBA. More information about the DAA’s YourAdChoices program and its opt-out tool are available here. Opting out from an advertiser will not, however, automatically opt you out of receiving IBA/OBA targeted ads from our Platform, nor from receiving ads. To opt out of targeted ads from our Platform, you may go here. We do, however, require advertisers and publishers with whom we partner to inform us if you opt-out of receiving their ads so that you are not sent those ads from our Platform.

Since we are a member of the NAI, you may also use the NAI’s opt-out tool to opt-out of our collection of data online for IBA and the placement of interest based ads. You may access the NAI’s opt-out tool here.

The DAA and NAI opt-out tools are cookie-based. They signal us so that we do not collect data online or deliver ads for the purpose of IBA/OBA, and only affect the Internet/web browser on the computer where the cookies are installed. These opt-out tools will only function if your browser is set to accept third-party cookies. If you delete an opt-out cookie or all cookies from a browser’s cookie files, change web browsers or change computers, you will no longer be opted out of our data collection and ad targeting, and we may place a new cookie unless an opt-out cookie is again reset on that browser. Opting out using one browser on one computer will not opt you out using any other browser on the same or another computer.

If you are using a mobile device, your mobile device may offer settings to limit or disable mobile apps from gathering certain information. You should check the settings for the app and your device. PulsePoint honors the mobile device settings for Android and Apple iOS devices. To exercise this opt-out, please visit the privacy settings of your device and select “limit ad tracking” (if Apple iOS) or “opt-out of interest based ads” (if Android).

Collection, Use, and Disclosure of Information by Others
This Privacy Policy applies only to information gathered by us in connection with our Platform. There are other companies involved in collecting information and serving ads. The use of third-party pixels, cookies, and other technologies on websites that end-users visit, in apps that end-users use, and in ads served to end-users should be described by the privacy policies associated with those websites, apps, and ads. We have no responsibility for the collection, use, or disclosure of information by those third parties via such websites, apps, or ads.

Security
We use reasonable security measures to protect the data in our possession. However, no method of transmission or storage of data is 100% secure and we will not be responsible for any damage that results from a security breach of data or the unauthorized access to or use of information, whether PII or Non-PII. To the extent we provide your PII to any third parties, we will request that they use reasonable security measures to protect your information.

Data Retention
Information we acquire through our Platform is generally deleted within 45-60 days, but may be retained in PulsePoint’s internal network for up to 18 months from the date of collection before deletion.

We retain information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).  

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your data, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your PII has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your PII and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

Access Requests
If you would like to access, correct, update, or request deletion of your PII we have on file, you may submit such requests here. Alternatively, you may email us at privacy@pulsepoint.com or write to PulsePoint Privacy Department, 360 Madison Avenue, 14th Floor, New York, New York, 10017. We may take reasonable steps to confirm your identity in an effort to prevent identity theft.

Children's Privacy
In the interest of the privacy of children, we do not knowingly collect information from or target end-users under the age of 18. Our Platform is neither developed for nor directed at children. If we learn we have collected or received information from a child under 18 without verification of parental consent, we will endeavor to delete that information

Cross-Border Data Transfers
Our Platform is based in the United States, and operates under United States law. If you are located outside of the United States, the information we collect may be transferred to and processed in the United States and in other countries where the privacy laws may not be the same as the laws where you reside and, in some cases, may not be as protective. Additional considerations apply to the collection, use, and disclosure of information from individuals who live in the EEA.

Do Not Track (""DNT"")
DNT is a privacy preference that you may set in certain web browsers. DNT is intended to allow you another method of informing websites and services that you do not want certain information about your website visits collected. We do not currently respond to DNT signals.

ra1,"INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT\n\nWhere we collect information:\n\nPulsePoint operates advertising technology, and as such, has many partners in the ad tech ecosystem that it works with in order to provide advertisements to end users of websites, Apps, and other various advertising platforms and media. When a consumer or other end user browses the internet, that browser or device may request advertisements from PulsePoint’s Platform. Through the serving of those advertisements or through other Platform analytics, we and our partners, including website or application publishers, advertising partners, or third-party data providers from whom we license data, may automatically collect information that is linked to your computer or device that may reflect how you interact with a webpage, the advertisements you view or click, or other information from your mobile device.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
ra1,Other companies within the Internet Brands group may have access to information collected by PulsePoint.  ,Categories of Personal Information Shared / Disclosed
ra1,"Types of information we may collect:\n\nMost of the information PulsePoint may collect is non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”), which is information that does not identify you personally but may enable us to recognize your computer or device in the future. For example, when you visit a website or click an ad, we or our service providers may collect information such as:\n\nWebsites you have visited and related information, such as pages visited or the time of day you visited the website;\nAds served, viewed, or clicked on, such as the time of day of your visit, where the ad was served, whether you clicked on it, and whether you visited the advertiser’s website or purchased the product or service advertised;\nApps visited, the start and stop time of a use session, your time zone and your network connection type;\nMobile device information, such as the type and model, software version, manufacturer, operating system (e.g., iOS or Android), carrier name, mobile browser (e.g., Chrome or Safari), applications used and the version of such applications, and identifiers assigned to your device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), Android Advertising ID (AAID), or unique device identifier (a number uniquely given to your device by your device manufacturer), sometimes referred to as a mobile carrier ID;\nYour Internet protocol (IP) address;\nCTV/OTT information about video content viewed on a device or app;\nLocation information, such as your zip code or approximate geographic area provided by your ISP or by location services and GPS features of a website or mobile device. GPS location may be shared with us if you have opted to provide that information to us or our partners. We may also infer geolocation of your device based on data collected through, for example, a WiFi identifier;\nDemographic information such as age range, gender, and income range.\nWe may also collect Non-PII from third parties that is not linked to your computer or mobile device for use in our Platform. Any information we receive from third parties is used to maintain and improve the accuracy of the records we hold about you.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
ra1,"Personally Identifiable Information\n\nPersonally identifiable information (“PII”) is information unique to you that may be used to directly identify you individually. We may acquire PII from our publishers, advertising partners, or other third parties, but only where we have contractually required that these third parties have obtained your consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your PII to us. Depending on the source, the PII may include information such as your email address or certain specific demographic information. More precise location positioning, or location information combined with other data, may make it possible to pinpoint an exact location, which in some instances could be considered PII.\n\nFrom time to time, advertisers or their agencies may serve advertisements through our Platform that enable you to enter personal information into the advertisement or other form fields, which may allow you to receive more information from an advertiser. In the event that you elect to enter into your personal information into such an advertisement or form field, we may collect such information solely for the purpose of providing services to the applicable advertiser or its agency.",Categories of Personal Information Collected

ra1,"Health Information\n\nPulsePoint specializes in health advertising and may collect and use general health-related information when delivering ads, based on interest in topics found on sites or ads that such a user has interacted with in the past. For example, if you have previously interacted with a site that contains information on skin care, PulsePoint may collect that information about your browsing behavior and you may subsequently be shown an ad on another page for skin care-related products and services.\n\nWe also may contract with third parties to collect information that is de-identified for our purposes but is data related to past, present or future medical conditions and treatment of those conditions, including filled prescription data. PulsePoint will never attempt to re-identify this data back to a specific individual.  ",Categories of Personal Information Collected
ra1,"HOW WE USE COLLECTED INFORMATION\n\nWe use the information we acquire to provide optimized, tailored advertising and provide insights about an ad campaign. For example, we may use both PII and Non-PII gathered from ads we have placed to provide our clients with ad-related services, such as statistical reporting about website activity and the number of ads served, and to provide more ads to end-users based on the specific website URL, or webpage, visited.\n\nWe also use the information we acquire to serve ads to more targeted audiences as explained below. We consider your PII and precise location information to be confidential information. Accordingly, we will obtain your consent, or, when we acquire that information from third parties, we will request that they obtain it in compliance with applicable law, and where required by applicable law or our self-regulatory obligations, secure your consent to provide the information to us and for us to use and share your information with others as explained in this Privacy Policy, including for interest-based advertising (“IBA”) purposes.",Categories of Personal Information Collected

For example, we may develop audience segments (groupings of individuals with common interests or characteristics) and deliver ads to those segments as appropriate, or to websites that we believe are relevant to and frequented by users of a particular segment. For example, if you are a student, we may deliver ads for school course offerings or financial aid. Segments may be based on demographic characteristics such as age and gender, geographic area, and other categories derived from various information. We also collect and maintain health-related data segments to allow our clients to provide these kinds of tailored advertising services to end users. Any health-related data segments used for targeting will not include sensitive health information, such as your actual diagnosis for a particular condition or any of your past online behavior with respect to conditions like cancer or mental health disorders.

For example, if an advertiser wants us to display ads to individuals who have expressed interest in acne, sun-care products, or advances in treating certain medical conditions, we may serve ads for those products or services to those individuals based on segment data and Internet browsing habits. We may also serve ads to you based on inferences we have made regarding health-related information that may be of interest to you. We may make these inferences using models based on a sample set of other users’ health records, which we then compare with information in our databases to create datasets we can use to make certain predictions or inferences regarding characteristics that may apply to you, including the likelihood of the existence of certain medical conditions.

In some instances, a cookie is placed on your computer while at the advertiser’s site, and when that cookie is seen by us on the website of another company in our Platform, we will deliver the advertiser’s ad there.

ra1,"We or our service providers may deliver ads to your mobile device when you are in certain geographic locations. This type of targeted advertising is referred to as “geo-fencing” or “geo-targeting.” Geo-fencing works by placing a “fence” around a certain geographic (“geo”) location.  For example, we or one of our service providers could create a 2 square mile “fence” around a grocery store. When you go inside that fence or target area, we or our service providers may serve you specific ads based on your being in that target area. In such instance, you may, for example, be served ads about the grocery store or a product sold in that grocery store.  \n\nWith geo-fencing we do not continuously, periodically, or intermittently track your precise location.  The geo location of your device will, however, be provided to us or one of our service partners when you enter the target area, and we may also be provided other Non-PII. Geo-fencing monitors an area and sends notifications either to an app you have on your mobile device or directly to us or our service providers when the boundary is crossed, either in or out. Those apps use this location information to process status updates only if you have geo-location enabled on your mobile device. We will not target you with ads based on your geo-location unless we believe you have provided consent to do so.  ",Categories of Personal Information Collected

For example, we may provide information to others as to the specific ads to which a segment of end-users was exposed, or we may make certain information, such as certain demographic information, about end-users viewing an ad available to buyers and potential buyers of such ads. We may also disclose how frequently the average end user requests pages about a certain category (such as health or finance), or which ads a segment of end-user interacts with on domains across our Platform.\n\nThe Non-PII information that we share, including the Non-PII that is not linked to your computer, mobile device, or connected TV or app, does not directly identify you, but there is a risk that third parties who receive such information from us may be able to re-identify you through other information they gather. However, we require written assurances from third parties that they will not attempt to re-identify non-PII to any particular individual.\n\nIn addition to the uses noted in this Privacy Policy, we also may disclose PII and Non-PII under the following circumstances: (1) if required by law, such as by a court order, statute, regulation, rule or through legal process; (2) in response to requests from federal, state, local, or foreign law and civil enforcement agencies, such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, or for law enforcement purposes; (3) in the event of a corporate transaction such as the sale of assets or all or most of PulsePoint’s assets or equity to another company; (4) in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of our creditors; or (5) if we determine it necessary in connection with an investigation or in order to protect our legal rights.\n\nWe may also disclose your PII and Non-PII to our parent companies, affiliates, subcontractors, vendors, and other businesses who provide data processing services to us, or who otherwise process PII for purposes that are either described in this Privacy Policy or notified to you when we collect your PII.
