Service Providers are persons or entities that we contract with to provide a material service in connection with managing or assisting with the completion of our business objectives or fulfilling our responsibilities to our clients for whom we also act as a service provider. This may include, for example, data analytics providers, data service providers, data brokers, or data scrubbers. Information that we typically may receive from our service providers includes new or updated name, contact and location information, business and employment information, date of birth, social security number, bankruptcy and litigation information, military and deceased status, etc.\n\nInformation We Receive From Third Parties.\nThe Company receives and maintains personal information from third party sources, such as data licensors, data analytics providers, data brokers, and/or data suppliers that sell or grant to Company the right and license to access and use consumer personal information. Company uses this personal information for integration into its products and services or subscriptions that Company markets or sells to its direct end-user clients, and for sale or license to other companies that may further resell or use the information and integrate or incorporate it into their own transaction-based products or services.

The Site can only collect such information if it is affirmatively provided by you.\n\nLike most websites, however, the Site automatically collects certain non-personally identifiable information during a user’s visit. That information may include the internet protocol (IP) address of your device, the location where the device is accessing the internet, browser type and language, internet service provider, type of computer/operating system, date/time stamps, user interface interaction data (e.g., mouse clicks or navigation through the Site), and other information about the usage of the Site, including a history of pages viewed and or uniform resource locator (URL) information (showing where you came from or where you go to next). We use this information to improve the Site’s design, estimate user volume and usage patterns, speed up searches, and improve the user experience.  We may also use this information to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website, analyze trends, track visitor movements, and gather broad demographic information that assists us in identifying visitor preferences.\n\nMore specifically:\n\n     (i)  IP Address\nEach time a user visits the Site, we may automatically collect an internet protocol (IP) address and the web page from which the user was directed to the Site.
