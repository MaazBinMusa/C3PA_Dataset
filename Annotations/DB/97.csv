We also receive this same information from Server to Server partners. We provide our XDK to Publishers to help them monetize their Apps using location in order for them to provide free media, games, and other mobile services and activities such as weather forecasts or traffic updates. We also use our XDK in our X-Mode Apps.\n\nAdvertisers use the location data collected by the XDK in Apps and X-Mode Apps, and received from Server to Server partners, to enhance their ability to show ads in mobile apps, to target more relevant ads in mobile apps, and to analyze how well ads perform in mobile apps. (If you would like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in Section 6 below, entitled “Consumer Choices and Opt-Out Options”). Some advertisers may use location data or “interest segments” across devices or browsers (e.g., tablets, mobile devices, browsers, or televisions).\n\nAn SDK (which stands for “software development kit”) is a string of computer code that Publishers can include in their apps to collect data, often related (as in our case) to the mobile advertising and data industry. Publishers can embed our SDK into their apps in order to help or allow advertisers to enhance their ability to show ads in their Apps, to target more relevant ads in their Apps, and to analyze how well ads perform in their Apps Publishers work with us to monetize their App content in other ways we describe in this Privacy Policy. (If you would like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in Section 6 below, entitled “Consumer Choices and Opt-Out Options”).\n\nWhen you download and use an App or X-Mode App that uses our Services (the XDK) and have System Location Services “On” and Limit Ad Tracking “OFF”, the XDK can collect certain information through or about the Device, in particular:\n\nPrecise Location Data:\nGeolocation of the Device, usually expressed by latitude-longitude coordinates obtained through GPS features of our XDK, WiFi data, cell tower triangulation and other techniques.\nDwell time near points of interest (or how long your device stayed at one place).\nRelative Location Data:\nBluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) sensors, or beacons,\nSignals from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices.\nNear-field Communication (NFC)\nThe GPS capabilities of our XDK allow it to receive signals from each of these technologies that show when a Device is close by. For example, many retail stores have beacons that detect when a Bluetooth-enabled Device passes by or goes into the store. Shopping malls, stadiums, restaurants, museums and other similar points of interest may also use beacons.\nAdvertising IDs, or Unique Device Identifiers for Advertising (Android ID or iOS IDFA)\nTime and Date Information\nEvent information about your Device, which means:\nAny crashes\nSystem activity\nHardware settings\nUsage Data is automatically collected and cannot identify an individual user, which means:\nDevice type (i.e. iPhone 7)\nOperating system version and type (i.e. iOS 13.2)\nDevice settings (for example whether or not you have enabled Location Services)\nDevice time zone\nDevice carrier\nCurrent IP address\nApplications on which our XDK is embedded\nVisitors\nX-Mode, and service providers and vendors we work with, also collect information from visitors (“Visitors”) to our corporate website including any website on which this Privacy Policy is posted (collective, the “Site”) and information voluntarily and directly provided by Visitors on our contact forms or sent to our support email addresses, including hello@xmodesocial.com and support@xmodesocial.com.

We also license the information to Trusted Partners to power solutions in government planning, security, and law enforcement.\nInterest-Based Segments and Ad Targeting:\nInterest Based-Segments: We also use these observations to categorize Device users into “interest segments” (for instance, that a device is associated with an interest in attending sporting events, or department stores) that the Trusted Partners we license information to can use to send ads to users when the same users appear on their own mobile platforms.\nAd Targeting: By using interest segments, marketers are more likely to be able to send an offer that a consumer is more likely to want and less likely to find annoying.\nAttribution:\nAttribution Analysis: We use some of the information we collect and receive (including location information and Advertising IDs) to help advertisers analyze aggregate ad performance – such as by measuring whether or how Devices that saw a particular ad tended to engage with a particular product or visit a particular venue; this practice is sometimes called “attribution” analysis.\nFor instance, if numerous Devices were sent an ad or offer for “X-Mode Pizza” on Tuesday, and the Device “traffic” at X-Mode Pizza on Wednesday or Thursday was particularly high, an advertiser might conclude that the ad campaign was successful.\nPublisher Insights:\nInsights and Compliance: We help the Publishers that we work with understand more about the users of their own apps – using the same types of interest segments we have described above.\nWe can also use that information to inform Publishers of compliance options with applicable laws and guidelines where applicable.",Categories of Personal Information Sold

ra3,"\n9. The E.U. (GDPR)\nThe GDPR requires X-Mode and those using our services to provide users with certain information about the processing of their “Personal Data”. “Personal Data” is a term used in Europe that means, generally, data that identifies or can identify a particular unique user or device – for instance, names, addresses, cookie identifiers, mobile device identifiers, precise location data, and biometric data.\n\nIf you have any questions about X-Mode’s data practices in the context of the GDPR, you may contact our Data Protection Officer at privacy@xmodesocial.com.\n\nTo comply with the GDPR, we provide the below representations and information, which are specific to persons located in EEA countries or Switzerland (so please don’t rely on the below, if you’re not):\n\nLegal grounds for processing your Personal Data: The GDPR requires us to tell you about the legal basis we’re relying on to process any Personal Data about you. The legal basis for us processing your Personal Data for the purposes set out in Section 2 and Section 3 above (and Section 5 as to our corporate Trusted Partner data) will typically be because:\nYou provided your consent. In order to provide our services that involve use of precise location information related to other Personal Data, (and to store and gain access to information stored on your device such as Advertising IDs), we rely on your consent. To obtain this consent, we rely on our own compliance steps and our web and mobile partners’ compliance steps, designed to ensure that consent is collected and passed on to partners, and to ensure that we only facilitate the collection of legally obtained data. We may choose to obtain consent in other cases as well, in which case we will adhere to applicable laws relating to such consent and its withdrawal. We also seek to obtain consent for certain partners with whom we work, who are often independent data controllers. We list these partners in our List of Partners, below.\nThe processing is in our legitimate interest. In some cases, we use legitimate interest as a legal basis for processing Personal Data. We rely on legitimate interest when we use Personal Data to maintain the security of our services, such as to detect fraud or to ensure that bugs are detected and fixed. We also rely on legitimate interest when we use our own Trusted Partners’ data (or Visitors’ data) to communicate with them about our Services or analyze our own Site activity.\nContractual Relationships: Sometimes, we process certain data as necessary under a contractual relationship we have (such as our Trusted Partner records and contact information).\nLegal Obligations: Finally, some processing of data may be necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations.\nTransfers of Personal Data: When we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA or Switzerland, we take steps to make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your Personal Data. In general, our data transfers of our Personal Data are safeguarded by European Standard Contractual Clauses and Data Processing Agreements where this is required by European Data Protection Law. Feel free to contact us at the contact information below for more information about the safeguards we have put in place to protect your Personal Data and privacy rights in these circumstances.\nPersonal Data Retention: As a general matter, we retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to provide our Services, or for other important purposes such as complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. We generally retain Advertising IDs on the following schedule: we render Advertising IDs inactive for purposes of providing our services within 13 months from receipt of consent (or from any “refreshed” consent permitting us to continue to retain information), provided that we may retain data for longer periods, as needed, where we have fully de-identified such data in a manner so that it cannot be linked to Personal Data, Please note that we may retain this (and other) Information whenever and so long as we have a significant legal or operational need to do so, such as for auditing, corporate record-keeping, compliance accounting or security and bug-prevention purposes.\nYour Rights as a Data Subject: The GDPR provides you with certain rights in respect of Personal Data that data controllers hold about you, including certain rights to access Personal Data, to request correction of the Personal Data, to request to restrict or delete Personal Data, and to object to our processing of your Personal Data (including profiling for online ad targeting). More specifically,\nRight to Access: If you wish to exercise your right to access Personal Data we process as a data controller, you may do so by requesting access through the e-mail address privacy@xmodesocial.com. When we receive your request, we will provide you with current, step-by-step instructions to follow in order to obtain access. As we are required to verify a requestor’s identity prior to providing Personal Data, we will assess requests to exercise certain data access rights on a case-by-case basis: in doing so, we consider (a) the difficulty of verifying whether data that we hold and data we have linked to it truly and solely belongs to the data subject making the request, along with (b) the potential adverse effects on disclosure of personal data to the wrong individual. Because such improper disclosure would likely adversely affect the privacy rights and freedoms of the data subject, we may limit the Personal Data we make available. Please note that we will only grant requests for access for Personal Data for which we are a data controller, as explained further in sub-section (e) below. Where we act as a processor for one of our Trusted Partners, we will refer your request to that Trusted Partner. Please identify the Trusted Partner your request refers to (if possible), to simplify this process.\nRight to Correct: If you wish to exercise your right to correct Personal Data, you may do so by contacting us at the contact information below.\nRight to Object to Processing or to Withdraw Consent: By using the device-based “opt-out” signals described in Section 6 of this Privacy Policy, you may withdraw consent for processing on which we rely on consent. If you do so, we will cease processing your Personal Data for purposes of our services within 30 days or less. We either collect these opt-out signals ourselves or receive them from the mobile apps we work with.\nRight to Erasure: You also have the right to obtain the erasure of Personal Data concerning you that we hold as a controller. The above opt-out process satisfies this right. When a user opts-out through our partners (or through mobile device settings), and we receive this signal, we no longer use Personal Data to provide our advertising services. We will also manually delete your Personal Data if prefer that we do so; please contact us and email your device to privacy@xmodesocial.com for further instructions if you wish to exercise this right manually. Please note, however, that we may retain copies of certain Personal Data on inactive or back-up files, for our certain important internal and purposes, such as auditing, accounting and billing, legal or bug-detection, for as long as is necessary to fulfill those purposes.\nRight to Lodge Complaints: You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. However, we hope that you will first consult with us, so that we may work with you to resolve any complaint or concern you might have.\nX-Mode sometimes is a data controller and sometimes is a data processor. EU data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process Personal Data for their own purposes (known as “data controllers”) and organizations that process Personal Data on behalf of other organizations (known as “data processors”). As noted above, we are not always a data controller of the data in our possession but are sometimes a data processor for other companies such as our Trusted Partners (for instance, when we receive or process personal data on behalf of our Trusted Partners). In such cases, we may direct your inquiry to the relevant data controller, since data controllers are the ones with primary responsibility for your Personal Data.\n",Others
