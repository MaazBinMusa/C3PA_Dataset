We also may share any of the personal information we collect as follows:

Sharing for Legal Purposes: In addition, we may share personal information with third parties in order to: (a) comply with legal process or a regulatory investigation (e.g. a subpoena or court order); (b) enforce our Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy, or other contracts with you, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; and/or (d) protect the rights, property or personal safety of us, our platform, our customers, our agents and affiliates, its users and/or the public.

‍Sharing In Event of a Corporate Transaction: We may also share personal information in the event of a major corporate transaction, including for example a merger, investment, acquisition, reorganization, consolidation, bankruptcy, liquidation, or sale of some or all of our assets, or for purposes of due diligence connected with any such transaction.

YOUR CALIFORNIA RIGHTS AND CHOICES\nWithout being discriminated against for exercising these rights, Residents of California and Other Applicable States have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect from you, to delete that information, and to opt-out of the sale of your personal information, subject to certain restrictions. You also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. This section describes how to exercise those rights and our process for handling those requests, to the extent as act as a “business” (as opposed to a “service provider”) for purposes of handling personal information.  (To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.

a. Right to Opt-out of the sale of your personal information.

Residents of California and Other Applicable States may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information. Certain of these laws broadly define what constitutes a “sale” – including in the definition making available a wide variety of information in exchange for “valuable consideration.” We may act as a “business” or a “service provider” under the CCPA.  When we act as a business under the CCPA, you may “opt out” of our “sale” of your personal information (as those terms are defined by the CCPA)  by following the directions set forth in our Privacy Policy addressing how consumers may opt out of cross-app advertising through their device settings.

b. Right to request deletion of your personal information

You may also request that we delete any personal information that we collected from you, such as if you have been a customer of ours.  To make such a request, please send an email to privacy@veraset.com. (Note that this is different from your right to “opt out” of us selling your personal information, which is described below; also note that we do not generally collect personal information directly from consumers, in which case “deletion” rights generally do not apply.)
\nHowever, we may retain personal information for certain important purposes, such as (a) to protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality (such as de-bugging purposes), (c) as necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) to comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.  Additionally, we need certain types of information so that we can provide our Services to you.  If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use our Services.
\nc. Right to request access to or correction of your personal information

Residents of California and Other Applicable States also have the right to request that we disclose what categories of your personal information we collect, use, or sell.  As a California resident, you may request access to the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected from you.

Residents of California and Other Applicable States may learn more how to exercise these rights of information access by sending an email to privacy@veraset.com, submitting a request to Request Information, or by contacting us at (855) 856-3404.

 \n\nWe will then request certain information about you, including your device identifier (and we may request a screen shot of that identifier).
\nResidents of California and Other Applicable States likewise may have a right to request and in some cases to receive access to the specific pieces of personal information that has been collected about them, upon making a verifiable request.    We are not able to provide (or, ultimately, to correct) such specific pieces of personal information, beyond basic device information and identifiers, because we are not able to verify to a reasonably high degree that the personal information we have pertains to the person who has submitted the request, or whether either the person in possession of a device or the person requesting the information is the actual device owner.   (Certain studies have concluded that many people do not, or do not sufficiently, password-protect their mobile devices.)

Moreover, because we do not collect information such as name, address or email address (which we avoid, to protect consumer privacy), we do not have other, more conventional ways to verify the identify of an actual device owner.

If you are uncomfortable with your device information being used in the ways described above, we recommend that you request an “opt out” your information as described above.
\nWe will, however, provide categories and certain device information once we have verified your identity, and at that time we will respond to your request as appropriate:
\nWe encourage you to review and, as desired, employ the industry tools listed in our privacy policy addressing how consumers may opt out of cross-app advertising.  as we believe they may be more efficient, immediate and uniform – and easier to instantly access – than a more manual “opt out” process.

d. How to exercise your access, opt-out and (if applicable) deletion rights

Residents of California and Other Applicable States may exercise their California privacy rights by sending an email to privacy@veraset.com, submitting your request to Optout, or by contacting us at (855) 856-3404.
\nFor security purposes (and as required under California law), we will verify your identity – in part by requesting certain information from you — when you request to exercise the privacy rights described in this Addendum.  For instance, if you request categories or specific pieces of personal information we have received about you, you may need to confirm your possession of an identifier (such as an email address) or to provide a piece of identification that confirms you are the person you claim to be.

Once we have verified your identity, we will respond to your request as appropriate:

Where you have requested the categories of personal information that we have collected about you, we will provide a list of those categories.
Where you have requested that we delete personal information that we have collected from you, we will seek to confirm whether your request is for an “opt out” or a “deletion”:  because “opt out” or “do not sell” rights enable us to maintain your information for “suppression” purposes – i.e., to prevent us from selling information about you in the future (which is what many consumers requesting “deletion” actually desire to occur), we try to explain this in order to ensure we are meeting consumers’ preferences.  (In addition, “deletion” rights only apply to information that we have collected “from” consumers – which does not apply to much of the information in our databases.)
Upon completion of the above process, we will send you a notice that explains the categories of personal information we were able to locate about you, whether we (1) deleted, (2) de identified, or (3) retained the information we collected from you. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law.
If we are unable to complete your requests fully for any of the reasons above, we will provide you additional information about the reasons that we could not comply with your request.  If you disagree with a determination we have made, or feel that we have not sufficiently honored your valid requests, you may appeal to us by describing your concerns in an email to privacy@veraset.com.
