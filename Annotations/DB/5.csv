ra2,"Strict policies are in place to ensure that only high-quality sites are selected for VDX.tv’s network. Adding publishers evolves from a two-step process:\n\nSite Acceptance: Publishers must meet the VDX.tv Publisher Code of Conduct before being accepted. Manual quality checks are performed by VDX.tv employees to ensure compliance. Sites are also constantly scanned by our proprietary PageGuardTM technology and are removed if questionable content is found\n\nSite Acceptance: Transparent site lists are always made available for advertisers to approve or remove sites that are not an appropriate match for their brand\n\nDomain Verification: Before a new site goes live, they must identify all domains that they will/might run an VDX.tv ad on. After the publisher submits the domain(s), VDX.tv employees manually vet the domain for brand-safety purposes. This process and proprietary technology prevents publishers from accidentally or intentionally retrafficking our ads to questionable sites\n\nDomain Verification: If the domain is approved, it is added into the ‘approved domain’ list. VDX.tv’s ad server references this approved list to learn where it is and is not allowed, to serve an impression\n\nDomain Verification: If a non-approved domain calls our ad server for an ad, the ad server rejects the request and will NOT serve that domain an ad\n\n1.2 Publisher Code of Conduct Overview The VDX.tv Publisher Code of Conduct defines types of prohibited content (i.e. pornography, copyright infringement, spam, fraud, pyramid schemes, etc…) and types of prohibited actions (i.e. tag re-trafficking, altering ad creative, pay for clicks/impressions, timed rotations/auto-refresh, etc…)\n\n1.2 Publisher Code of Conduct Overview Publisher domains are approved at VDX.tv’s discretion (i.e. no publishers with downloadable software, no publishers that may be harmful to the business reputation of VDX.tv)\n\n1.3 Inventory acquired through RTB We supplement our on-network activity with inventory acquired off-network.. We typically use TAG-certified (https://www.tagtoday.net/registry) exchange partners, where feasible.. We always run activity via a pre-vetted domain Accept list, unless otherwise agreed with the client.. Our list of partners is available for review, although please note, this is subject to change.\n\n1.4 Ads.txt We support ads.txt and have done so since its launch in 2017.. Any inventory acquired through RTB is also ads.txt compliant..
