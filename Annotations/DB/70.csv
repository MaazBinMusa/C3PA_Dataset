DPI is the sole owner of the information collected through our websites or directly by our company representatives. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email, contact form, or other direct contact initiated by you. We may gather your name, address, email address, telephone number, IP Address, and/or Mobile Device ID in your voluntary use of our websites or when you contact our representatives.

We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us, and for appropriate follow-up. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship an order, or as a means to enhance our communications with you (like via an email provider). This information is used solely to help us better communicate directly with you. We do not sell or rent this information to anyone.

Unless you specifically ask us not to, we may contact you via telephone, email, text message, or online display in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.

B. Information We License from Third-Parties

Our core business is relicensing consumer and business information to help our clients market their products and services more effectively. The products we sell contain information on individuals and households that we license from third-parties. The information we license to our clients is collected by our third-party partners from many sources. These sources include public records, publicly available information, subscription information, warranty cards, surveys, point-of-sale information, website directories, website visits, online activity, mobile applications, and commercially available consumer data from other third-party information providers who may or may not have collected the data directly from you.

Some of this information may have been modeled or inferred from other information. For example, if you subscribe to a bridal magazine we might assume (i.e., infer) that you are engaged to be married. Or, the provider of information might make a calculated estimate of your home’s value based on the known values of surrounding homes (i.e., modeling). We may also use personal data to construct a non-existent “average consumer” that encompasses certain average characteristics of consumers who buy or do not buy (i.e., profiling). Inferring, modeling, and profiling are common practices used in trying to match consumers with products and services they are most likely to want when exact information is not available or feasible.

Identifiers such as name, address, and telephone numbers are sourced from publicly accessible sources such as the white and yellow page telephone directories, online directories, website postings, public records, public websites, property and assessor files, governmental issued licenses, and information available to the public through directory assistance.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
ra3,"What We Do with Information We License from Third-Parties

Our clients are small, medium, and large businesses, non-profit organizations, government agencies, and political organizations who want to market to consumers. Our clients use our products to enhance their marketing efforts and better align their products and services with consumer wants and needs.

Examples of the types of information we license for use in marketing are general contact information (like consumer and business names, titles, addresses, telephone numbers); consumer demographics (like age, gender, income, marital status, home value, net worth etc.); household makeup (like number of adults or presence of children); consumer buying behavior (like owning a boat, or buying pet toys); consumer interests (like an interest in golf); telecommunications characteristics (like whether you have a satellite dish or high-speed internet service); business firmographics (sales volume, number of employees, years in business, etc.); and life-event triggers (a recent move, purchase of a home, or recent marriage).

Our products are sometimes used by us (on behalf of our clients) or by our clients directly to draw inferences about consumers or develop predictive models. These predictions are used to make educated guesses about consumer preferences and future buying behavior and enable our clients to deliver marketing messages to the consumers who are most likely to want to receive them.

We may sometimes match different elements of information or points of contact together to help our clients engage in “multichannel” marketing. For example, a client with a list of telephone numbers of their customers may wish to add email addresses and mailing addresses to their list so they can reach their customers via email and direct mail. We may also use anonymized (hashed) versions of our information to match our products to our client’s files.

Ultimately, our goal is to help our clients ensure their marketing messages reach consumers who are most likely to want to receive them, and avoid consumers who don’t. Our clients ultimately use our information to send targeted offers to consumers and businesses via various marketing channels such as direct mail, telemarketing, digital ads, social media ads, mobile ads, etc.

The explanation and examples above are intended to give you a good idea of the major categories of information we maintain and most of the ways we use that information. However, it is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all the information we maintain and all the ways that information might be used.",Categories of Personal Information Collected

These predictions are used to make educated guesses about consumer preferences and future buying behavior and enable our clients to deliver marketing messages to the consumers who are most likely to want to receive them.

We may sometimes match different elements of information or points of contact together to help our clients engage in “multichannel” marketing. For example, a client with a list of telephone numbers of their customers may wish to add email addresses and mailing addresses to their list so they can reach their customers via email and direct mail. We may also use anonymized (hashed) versions of our information to match our products to our client’s files.

Ultimately, our goal is to help our clients ensure their marketing messages reach consumers who are most likely to want to receive them, and avoid consumers who don’t. Our clients ultimately use our information to send targeted offers to consumers and businesses via various marketing channels such as direct mail, telemarketing, digital ads, social media ads, mobile ads, etc.

The explanation and examples above are intended to give you a good idea of the major categories of information we maintain and most of the ways we use that information. However, it is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all the information we maintain and all the ways that information might be used.",Categories of Personal Information Sold
