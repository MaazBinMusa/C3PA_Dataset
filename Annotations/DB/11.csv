In certain circumstances where your personal information has been collected for marketing purposes and where permitted by applicable law, we may share the personal information with business partners in the ad tech sector for their own commercial marketing purposes. We may share the contact information you provide when registering for an event and share event attendee lists between our S&P Global divisions and with our webinar and conference partners, to ensure that your contact information is up to date and to administer, secure, and seek feedback on and promote our events. 

For a list of our current group companies and related companies, please see our latest filings here. A list of our service providers, content providers and business partners is available here. For information about the disclosure of the California enumerated categories please see the California jurisdictional section below.

In addition to the purposes described in this Policy, personal information handled by our service providers may be subject to their terms of use and privacy policies, which if applicable, will be provided to you. Please review any applicable service provider’s terms of use and privacy policies to better understand how they manage your personal information.

Your employer

We may provide personal information to your employer for purposes such as to fulfill and enforce our contract with them, to inform them of potential group training needs, to inform them of Service use by certain categories of users and for pricing purposes.

Competent law enforcement bodies, regulatory, government agency, court or other third parties

We may provide personal information to any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party in accordance with applicable law and regulation when we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes, (iii) to cooperate with relevant agencies for the investigation and prevention of crimes such as insider trading, (iv) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, (v) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person, or (vi) to protect the interests, rights, safety or property of us or others.

S&P Global is regulated by various federal and state agencies, authorities and similar regulatory bodies internationally and, in the normal course of business, both in the United States of America and abroad, is the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries. We may therefore disclose your information to comply with a court order, government request or other legal or regulatory process, sometimes without prior notice to you. 

Our SEC filings set this out in more detail and are available here.

Potential Buyers

We may provide personal information to a potential buyer or a target (and that third party’s or our agents and advisers) in connection with any proposed sale, purchase, merger, transfer, acquisition or liquidation or similar event, of all or any part of our businesses. If such a change happens to our business, the buyer or target will use your personal information in the same way as set out in this Policy or will inform you about how it will use your personal information as required by applicable law. 

Other third parties

Personal information that you disclose on message boards, chat areas or social media pages or in direct messages to other users of these platforms may be collected and used by third parties to contact you, to send you unsolicited messages or for other purposes without our knowledge or control. Social media forums and chat rooms not operated by us may have additional rules and conditions. We are not responsible for the personal information or any other information you choose to submit on these forums that are not controlled by us.

The Services may offer you the ability to share personal information through a social networking site (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) using integrated tools (e.g., Facebook “Like” button, or Twitter “Tweet” button). The use of such integrated tools enables you to share personal information about yourself with other individuals or the public, depending on the settings that you have established with such social networking site. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and use in connection with such social networking sites or a site’s integrated tools, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these social networking sites.

We encourage you to use caution when publicly disclosing your personal information.

We may ask for your consent to share your information with other unaffiliated third parties who are not described elsewhere in this Policy.
