ra3,"Information We Collect\nWe collect and use several types of information from you or from our data partners that help us (or our data partners) serve ads that are better tailored to your interests and to provide reporting and analytics services, such as inferring ads that performed better or worse based on user behavior.  This information includes:\n\nDevice identifiers\nEg., mobile advertising IDs like iOS IDFA and Android AAID, IP address, OTT/CTV IDs, gaming console IDs, cookie IDs, proprietary IDs, or other pseudonymized identifiers (e.g., a randomized string of characters).\nZIP +4 and ZIP +11 postal codes\nPublicly available household postal codes; used to identify a household address, which devices and segments are associated to for “household-level” targeting.\nHousehold identifiers\nPseudonymous IDs for ZIP+4/ZIP+11 above.\nHousehold addresses\nA master address list used for purposes such as address verification and appending ZIP11 and latitude/longitude.\nDevice metadata\nE.g., device type, browser type, operating system type, and settings.\nGeolocation data\nE.g., latitude/longitude coordinates or other geolocation information (e.g., based on IP address).\nSegments/demographics and interests\nA group of household IDs or device IDs that may share a common interest, trait, or preference, such as “auto intenders” or “guitar buyers”. These can be either our own segments or segments from data partners.\nWe may receive demographic information or use data science to understand general demographics or interests, which can be used to make inferences for segment purposes (e.g., household income, number of household members, geographic area, retail interests) or to understand the value of a certain advertising opportunity presented in a bid request.\nAd interaction data\nE.g., interactions with or in relation to an ad, such as clickthroughs, actions taken on landing page where ad takes you, app downloads, and purchases. This helps understand ad campaign effectiveness and what ads you respond more favorably to.\nThis interaction data and other ad analytics can sometimes be provided to data partners for measurement/attribution purposes, described below, in the form of a document called an “impression log.”\nOther ad analytics\nE.g., TV content viewed, viewership data, which ads were shown to which devices or households, where and what they were shown, and at what time.\nEmail addresses\nEmail addresses that are either uploaded in “plain text” and then matched with a hashed email or hashed by us or our clients/data partners (i.e., utilize one-way cryptography such that it is a random string of characters).\nClient information\nClients can upload their own information, such as their customer data, to our Platform (e.g., email addresses, postal address, device IDs) which we can then “match” with our own data and use for enhanced targeting.\n4. Source of Information We Collect\nThe above information is collected through various sources, including:\n\nClients\nAs mentioned above, clients can upload their own information to our Platform for matching and enhanced targeting purposes.\nBid requests\n“Bid requests” contain information describing advertising space that is available for purchase on that particular digital property (e.g., website, app, OTT device) and are typically sent by ad exchanges/sell-side platforms (SSPs). The fields within a bid request can depend on the specification (e.g., OpenRTB) but bid requests typically contain information about the particular user or device, such as device ID, geolocation information, content or URL being viewed, device metadata, and demographic information (e.g., age, gender).\nTV/OTT Platforms and App Providers\nThese entities may send similar information as those described in bid requests but can also send information regarding what video content is being watched on a device or app or viewership data more broadly.\nPixels/Cookies/Macros\nCookies are essentially small files of data that can be stored within a device to collect information across websites. Pixels are pieces of code that are inserted onto pages or ads, which can collect information from a device or read/write cookies.\nAd macros operate similar conceptually to pixels and also collect similar information in relation to ads that we have served\nMobile SDKs\nIn essence, the mobile version of pixels. These are usually placed by our partners within apps, which collects information that can be provided to us, such as device IDs or geolocation information.\nData Partners\nWe use a variety of partners that provide the information described in this Services Privacy Policy to us, such as consumer panel providers (i.e., provides insights from consumers based on surveys), geolocation providers, ad exchanges/SSPs mentioned above, other DSP or data management platforms (DMPs), measurement partners, address verification providers, point-of-interest (POI) data providers, and segment providers.\n",Categories of Personal Information Collected
ra3,"How We Use Information We Collect\nWe use the information we collect to help clients and data partners better target ads to you or analyze trends and create reports about how users react to such ads. More specifically, our uses include:\n\nAd delivery and personalization\nDelivery of a personalized ad based on your interests or the interests of a household.\nAudience/matching/onboarding\nMatching client-uploaded information, such as device IDs, with household information stored within our identity map to provide a broader range of targetable device IDs.\nDevice mapping\nInferring whether a device is associated to a household or other general location.\nAlso includes making correlations between actions on one device (such as a browser on a computer) with actions on another device (such as an app on a phone) to determine whether they belong to the same household or whether devices belong to the same user.\nSegment creation\nCreation of interest-based segments, as further described below.\nMeasurement\nMeasuring whether a user clicked on an ad, took some action afterwards (e.g., downloaded something, went to a retail store), ad viewability, and other analytics to determine how well an ad performed.\nAttribution\nInferred determination of whether a user took an action due to seeing an ad (e.g., saw an ad and then purchased something). In other words, trying to reasonably correlate whether an ad prompted the user action, however such action is defined.\nReporting\nA report on the performance of an ad campaign, based on measurement and attribution and associated analytics.\nFrequency capping and ad analytics\nTracking how many times an ad was shown to a particular user (and how many times a particular user should be seeing an ad in general), where the ad was displayed, and when.\nFraud detection\nPreventing invalid or fraudulent ad traffic or malicious activity, such as those caused by bots or malware.\nAnonymization\nInformation collected may be de-identified or anonymized and used for any purpose, including marketing or research purposes.\nMore about “segments”: We make certain inferences about you (on the device level, rather than directly identifying you by name, government identifier, phone number, or similar information) or about your household generally, in either case, based on the information collected above.\n\nFor example, we may analyze information associated with your mobile device ID, such as what apps you’ve viewed, what ads you’ve seen and clicked on (and actions you’ve taken afterwards), and where you are located, to determine whether that device, along with other devices, share certain interests, traits, or other demographics.  Where we have found these common interests, traits, or other demographics, we put those devices into “segments” (e.g., “interested in clothes,” “auto-intender,” “travel enthusiast”).\n\nIn many cases, we will look at these device-level characteristics to determine interests, traits, or demographics at the household level and roll those devices into these household-level segments (e.g., this household contains users interested in clothes, musical instruments, fashion, etc., or household race composition, income level, or education level).\n\nWe also receive segments from our data partners, including those of the nature described above and similar segments.\n\nOur segments, along with segments from our data partners, are made available within our Platform for clients to use to improve the targeting of their ad campaigns.  We also make available our own segments to other data partners, such as other DSPs or data management platforms (DMPs), for use by those partners’ clients.\n\nNote: In some cases, we receive certain health-related segments from our data partners, some of which may be considered “sensitive” under certain regulatory frameworks. We also create and receive political interest-based segments. Please see a list of our health-related and political interest-based segments, which includes both our standard segments and a representative list of our custom segments relating thereto.",Categories of Personal Information Shared / Disclosed

ra5," Information We Collect
We collect and use several types of information from you or from our data partners that help us (or our data partners) serve ads that are better tailored to your interests and to provide reporting and analytics services, such as inferring ads that performed better or worse based on user behavior.  This information includes:

Device identifiers
Eg., mobile advertising IDs like iOS IDFA and Android AAID, IP address, OTT/CTV IDs, gaming console IDs, cookie IDs, proprietary IDs, or other pseudonymized identifiers (e.g., a randomized string of characters).
ZIP +4 and ZIP +11 postal codes
Publicly available household postal codes; used to identify a household address, which devices and segments are associated to for “household-level” targeting.
Household identifiers
Pseudonymous IDs for ZIP+4/ZIP+11 above.
Household addresses
A master address list used for purposes such as address verification and appending ZIP11 and latitude/longitude.
Device metadata
E.g., device type, browser type, operating system type, and settings.
Geolocation data
E.g., latitude/longitude coordinates or other geolocation information (e.g., based on IP address).
Segments/demographics and interests
A group of household IDs or device IDs that may share a common interest, trait, or preference, such as “auto intenders” or “guitar buyers”. These can be either our own segments or segments from data partners.

Email addresses that are either uploaded in “plain text” and then matched with a hashed email or hashed by us or our clients/data partners (i.e., utilize one-way cryptography such that it is a random string of characters).
Client information
Clients can upload their own information, such as their customer data, to our Platform (e.g., email addresses, postal address, device IDs) which we can then “match” with our own data and use for enhanced targeting.",Categories of Personal Information Collected

ra4,"The above information is collected through various sources, including:

Clients
As mentioned above, clients can upload their own information to our Platform for matching and enhanced targeting purposes.
Bid requests
“Bid requests” contain information describing advertising space that is available for purchase on that particular digital property (e.g., website, app, OTT device) and are typically sent by ad exchanges/sell-side platforms (SSPs). The fields within a bid request can depend on the specification (e.g., OpenRTB) but bid requests typically contain information about the particular user or device, such as device ID, geolocation information, content or URL being viewed, device metadata, and demographic information (e.g., age, gender).
TV/OTT Platforms and App Providers
These entities may send similar information as those described in bid requests but can also send information regarding what video content is being watched on a device or app or viewership data more broadly.
Pixels/Cookies/Macros
Cookies are essentially small files of data that can be stored within a device to collect information across websites. Pixels are pieces of code that are inserted onto pages or ads, which can collect information from a device or read/write cookies.
Ad macros operate similar conceptually to pixels and also collect similar information in relation to ads that we have served
Mobile SDKs
In essence, the mobile version of pixels. These are usually placed by our partners within apps, which collects information that can be provided to us, such as device IDs or geolocation information.
Data Partners
We use a variety of partners that provide the information described in this Services Privacy Policy to us, such as consumer panel providers (i.e., provides insights from consumers based on surveys), geolocation providers, ad exchanges/SSPs mentioned above, other DSP or data management platforms (DMPs), measurement partners, address verification providers, point-of-interest (POI) data providers, and segment providers.",Categories of Personal Information Collected

Device mapping
Inferring whether a device is associated to a household or other general location.
Also includes making correlations between actions on one device (such as a browser on a computer) with actions on another device (such as an app on a phone) to determine whether they belong to the same household or whether devices belong to the same user.
Segment creation
Creation of interest-based segments, as further described below.
Measurement
Measuring whether a user clicked on an ad, took some action afterwards (e.g., downloaded something, went to a retail store), ad viewability, and other analytics to determine how well an ad performed.
Attribution
Inferred determination of whether a user took an action due to seeing an ad (e.g., saw an ad and then purchased something). In other words, trying to reasonably correlate whether an ad prompted the user action, however such action is defined.
Reporting
A report on the performance of an ad campaign, based on measurement and attribution and associated analytics.
Frequency capping and ad analytics
Tracking how many times an ad was shown to a particular user (and how many times a particular user should be seeing an ad in general), where the ad was displayed, and when.
