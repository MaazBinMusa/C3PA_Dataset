Data used to create online audiences is de-identified, helping ensure that neither the ad server nor our cookies contain personal data. We may assign a Near ID in our internal systems for your browser, computer or mobile device when we serve an ad to it or we identify it on a publisher partner’s website or mobile app. The Near ID and other information collected via the Services can also help our advertising customers measure the effectiveness of advertisements delivered via the Services. They enable the Services to determine within a reasonable level of confidence that a computer or device is the same as one with which the Services has previously interacted. For instance, the Services can determine that a computer or device to which we served an ad on Monday may be the same computer or device for which we observed a purchase on Tuesday. In other words, in such cases we are able to infer that a device (e.g. your computer) and another device (e.g. your smartphone) are used by the same owner.

3. ¿Cómo recopila o recibe Near los datos de los usuarios?
A través de los socios

Los SDK de los socios utilizados en las aplicaciones de los editores. Near recibe los identificadores de anuncios móviles y otros datos de los usuarios de sus socios que utilizan sus SDK en las aplicaciones de varios editores.
Conectores de API. Las API de Near están conectadas a las API de varios socios. Tales socios comparten los identificadores de anuncios móviles, las direcciones IP, la ubicación y otros datos de los usuarios a través de estas API.
Proveedores de redes de anuncios. Recibimos los identificadores de anuncios móviles y otra información sobre los usuarios de los proveedores de redes de anuncios móviles para fines de publicidad dirigida. En el caso de la publicidad dirigida a los usuarios de la Unión Europea, el Reino Unido y Suiza, Near es un proveedor aprobado y participa en el Marco de Transparencia y Consentimiento de IAB Europe (vea más en https://advertisingconsent.eu/about/). Utilizando este marco se obtiene el consentimiento legalmente suficiente de aquellos editores cuyas aplicaciones utilizan el marco. Además, los usuarios tienen la capacidad de retirar el consentimiento en cualquier momento poniéndose en contacto con el editor de la aplicación o el sitio relevantes, y verificando la configuración de privacidad de sus dispositivos, y de las aplicaciones y los sitios que usted visite de vez en cuando.
Socio editor de sitios web. Near recibe información e impresiones sobre los dispositivos de su socio editor de sitios web para prestar servicios de inteligencia de datos. Nuestros servicios podrían utilizar herramientas persistentes similares a las cookies, tales como la etiqueta JavaScript, que nos permitan medir la efectividad de los anuncios servidos y para la inteligencia de datos sobre las actividades de los usuarios en los sitios web. Los usuarios son libres de establecer su consentimiento en la configuración de su navegador, sistema operativo y dispositivo para desactivar la capacidad de identificar persistentemente su dispositivo. Por favor, consulte esta configuración para obtener más información sobre cómo deshabilitar las cookies en el navegador o sistema operativo y controlar sus preferencias, incluyendo la denegación del uso compartido de la información a nivel del dispositivo o la deshabilitación del acceso a la geolocalización.
Near no interactúa directamente con los usuarios mientras esté recibiendo datos a través de sus socios. Nuestros socios obtienen el consentimiento de los usuarios y comparten el consentimiento válido con nosotros. Near solo trabaja con socios que acepten notificar a los usuarios y buscar su consentimiento informándoles de que sus datos se capturarán y compartirán con terceros. Near solo almacena los datos que vengan con una prueba de consentimiento válido de sus socios.

4. ¿Cómo usa Near la información de los usuarios?
Nuestros servicios de inteligencia de datos implican la información de datos de estimación óptima y la presentación de informes a los clientes. Utilizamos nuestras herramientas patentadas para transformar los identificadores recopilados de anuncios móviles, junto con la información de la geolocalización aproximada y otros datos de los usuarios, en información procesable para nuestros clientes. Nuestra tecnología nos permite proporcionar a nuestros clientes análisis estadísticos y de tendencias, tales como la identificación de los patrones que mejorarán la relevancia de los anuncios, la provisión de anuncios a ciertos tipos de audiencias, la identificación y optimización de las áreas comerciales y las ubicaciones de las empresas, y la prestación de ayuda a nuestros clientes para tomar decisiones comerciales informadas sobre el comportamiento del consumidor con información sobre las tendencias y los movimientos. Proporcionamos información procesable, patrones y puntos en común para permitir que nuestros clientes comprendan las tendencias, y evalúen los productos y servicios que ofrecen, posibilitando el compromiso con la audiencia, y mejorando la experiencia del cliente en relación con un sitio web o una aplicación de comercio electrónico.
Los identificadores de anuncios móviles que recopilamos se almacenan en nuestros sistemas solo con fines publicitarios. Gran parte de la otra información recopilada se anonimiza aún más en archivos agregados, y mediante el uso de puntos de datos sin identificadores únicos o con solo un identificador cifrado. También jitterizamos aleatoriamente la geolocalización que recopilamos como otro paso para hacer que los datos sean menos personales. Vendemos clusters de información que incluyen identificadores cifrados de dispositivos con información jitterizada de geolocalización a clientes que utilizan nuestros servicios de inteligencia de datos. Esta información se utiliza de varias maneras para ofrecer a tales clientes información sobre las tendencias, informes y patrones comerciales.
Una parte de la tecnología conserva los identificadores de anuncios móviles para atender las solicitudes de publicidad dirigida, medición y coincidencia de nuestros clientes específicos de Estados Unidos. Estos datos se almacenan separadamente de los datos anonimizados.
Near ofrece servicios de curaduría de audiencias para la publicidad, la comprensión de las tendencias, etc., pero no crea segmentos de datos basados en información personal sensible (por ejemplo, la religión o solvencia). Sin embargo, podríamos crear segmentos relacionados con la salud, tales como un interés inferido en la dieta y el bienestar, pero no datos sensibles de salud, tales como las condiciones médicas o enfermedades. Todos nuestros clientes que se suscriben a nuestros servicios están obligados a cumplir con las leyes y los reglamentos aplicables de privacidad, así como también con nuestros requisitos contractuales. Near prohíbe el uso de sus servicios por parte de otros (a) para determinar la elegibilidad para un empleo, un crédito o la atención médica, (b) para determinar la elegibilidad para un seguro, o para suscribir o fijar el precio de un seguro, y (c) para el seguimiento o la vigilancia ilegales de individuos, o para generar información de identificación personal.
Nuestros servicios también incluyen servicios de publicidad que nos permiten ayudar a nuestros clientes publicitarios y editoriales a proporcionar publicidad y contenido más relevantes en las aplicaciones de nuestra red. En general, utilizamos la información de los usuarios recopilada de los socios para mejorar nuestros servicios de publicidad, proporcionando contenido de anuncios que esté más estrechamente relacionado con los intereses de los usuarios. Por ejemplo, la información se utiliza para crear audiencias agrupadas sobre la base de las preferencias compartidas (por ejemplo, los fanáticos de los deportes, los entusiastas de los automóviles, los cinéfilos y los viajeros) y para medir la eficacia de las campañas de anuncios. Los datos utilizados para crear audiencias en línea se anonimizan, lo que ayuda a garantizar que ni el servidor de anuncios ni nuestras cookies contengan datos personales. Podríamos asignar una identificación de Near para su navegador, computadora o dispositivo móvil en nuestros sistemas internos cuando le sirvamos un anuncio, o lo identifiquemos en el sitio web o la aplicación móvil de un socio editorial. La identificación de Near y otra información recopilada a través de los servicios también pueden ayudar a nuestros clientes publicitarios a medir la eficacia de los anuncios entregados a través de los servicios. Las mismas permiten que los servicios determinen dentro de un nivel razonable de confianza que una computadora o un dispositivo es el mismo con el que los servicios han interactuado previamente. Por ejemplo, los servicios pueden determinar que una computadora o un dispositivo al que le servimos un anuncio el lunes podría ser la misma computadora o dispositivo para el que observamos una compra el martes. En otras palabras, en tales casos podemos inferir que un dispositivo (por ejemplo, su computadora) y otro dispositivo (por ejemplo, su teléfono inteligente) son utilizados por el mismo propietario. Cuando podamos hacer tales inferencias, podríamos usar esta información para entregar anuncios dirigidos a través de varias computadoras o dispositivos. A esto se hace referencia a veces como publicidad en todos los dispositivos.
5. ¿Cuáles son las bases para procesar la información de los usuarios?
Near podría recopilar su información personal sobre la base de lo siguiente:
Su consentimiento;
La necesidad de cumplir con un contrato;
Nuestros intereses legítimos o los de un tercero;
La necesidad de cumplir con las leyes; o
Cualquier otro motivo, según lo exija o permita la ley.
Podríamos transferir datos de la Unión Europea a Estados Unidos para su procesamiento y por lo general lo haremos mediante las Cláusulas Contractuales Estándar de la Unión Europea a través de las cuales nos aseguramos de que el nivel de protección garantizado para sus datos personales por las leyes europeas no se vea afectado por tal transferencia. Además, podríamos compartir datos de los consumidores con nuestros proveedores de servicios y tal uso compartido podría constituir una transferencia fuera de su ubicación de origen, e incluso en todas esas transferencias celebramos las Cláusulas Contractuales Estándar de la Unión Europea con los respectivos proveedores de servicios.

Cuando Near reciba de un sujeto de datos de la Unión Europea una solicitud para dejar de procesar los datos a través de uno de los mecanismos de elección enumerados anteriormente, Near detendrá todo el procesamiento de datos con respecto al navegador o dispositivo móvil excluido, a menos que la ley exija tal procesamiento.

6. ¿Con quién compartimos la información de los usuarios y el fin de compartir esta información?
Near comparte inteligencia derivada de los datos recopilados con los clientes, los socios, los proveedores externos de servicios, las filiales de las compañías del grupo y un posible adquirente para los siguientes fines:

Clientes y socios

Cuando los clientes necesiten los identificadores de anuncios móviles para la publicidad dirigida, las mediciones y las coincidencias solo venderemos identificadores no cifrados de anuncios móviles para este fin. Nos aseguramos de que nuestros clientes no utilicen los identificadores de anuncios móviles para ningún otro fin, con la excepción de los fines mencionados inmediatamente arriba. Toda la otra información se vende de manera agregada y anonimizada que no puede identificarle. Esto es esencialmente para proporcionar segmentos, tendencias, patrones, informes y conocimientos a los clientes.

Proveedores externos de servicios

Con aquellas entidades que nos ayudan a hacer que los servicios estén disponibles y sean funcionales, como los agentes técnicos, los proveedores de procesamiento de pagos, otros subcontratistas, y nuestras filiales y consultores bajo contrato y con salvaguardas. Estas funciones incluyen, por ejemplo, el alojamiento de sitios web, el mantenimiento, el análisis de datos, la atención al cliente, los servicios de entrega de correo electrónico, los servicios de infraestructura, los agentes técnicos, y los servicios de análisis y medición. Se restringirá la manera en la que estos terceros puedan usar la información personal, y los mismos tendrán que mantener la confidencialidad y seguridad de su información.

Filiales de compañías del grupo

Near compartirá su información dentro del grupo de compañías de Near para garantizar que Near pueda prestar servicios a sus clientes.

Gobierno, organismos del orden público u organismos reguladores

Near compartirá su información con los organismos gubernamentales, legales o reguladores aplicables con el fin de cumplir con las leyes aplicables y las investigaciones, o para responder a una orden judicial, o a una citación judicial u otra citación gubernamental.

Adquiriente o entidad fusionada

Near podría transferir información, incluyendo cualquier dato personal, a una entidad sucesora en relación con una fusión, consolidación, venta de activos o quiebra corporativa, u otro cambio corporativo.

Otro

Near podría compartir sus datos personales con su consentimiento o si cree que esto protegerá a Near, a usted o a cualquier otra persona o tercero, o para hacer valer cualquier derecho legal.

7. Seguridad
La seguridad de su información es importante para nosotros. Near ha implementado medidas razonables de seguridad para proteger la información bajo nuestro cuidado, tanto durante la transmisión como una vez que haya sido recibida. Esto incluye pero no se limita al uso de firewalls y el cifrado. Ningún método de transmisión por Internet ni método de almacenamiento electrónico es 100% seguro. Por consiguiente, aunque nos esforzamos por utilizar medios comercialmente aceptables para proteger su información, no podemos garantizar la seguridad absoluta.

8. ¿Recopilan ustedes información sobre niños?
Near no recopila a sabiendas datos personales de ninguna persona menor de 13 años de edad a través del sitio. Si usted cree que su hijo le ha proporcionado a Near información personal, tal como al inscribirse en una de nuestras aplicaciones sin el consentimiento de los padres, y le gustaría que se eliminen los datos, por favor, comuníquese con nosotros utilizando la información de contacto a continuación.

9. ¿Durante cuánto tiempo se almacenan los datos de los usuarios?
En el caso de los datos personales, solo conservamos sus datos mientras los necesitemos para nuestros fines comerciales legítimos. Por ejemplo, cuando recopilamos información sobre su interacción con un anuncio servido a usted, conservamos esa información durante 180 días y luego la eliminamos. Conservamos otra información, como las identificaciones de los dispositivos, para nuestros actuales servicios. Conservaremos su información mientras los servicios estén activos y, después de eso, durante un período que nos permita manejar o responder a cualquier queja, consulta o inquietud relacionada con los servicios. Revisaremos periódicamente los datos personales que tenemos y los eliminaremos de forma segura, o en algunos casos los anonimizaremos, cuando ya no haya una necesidad legal, comercial o del consumidor de conservarlos.

10. ¿Qué derechos tienen los usuarios?
Si usted proporciona su información personal y desea actualizar, corregir o eliminar errores en esa información, puede comunicarse con nosotros enviando un mensaje de correo electrónico a privacy@near.com. Responderemos a su solicitud antes de haber transcurrido un período razonable de tiempo. Por favor, consulte la página ""Opciones del consumidor"" para obtener más detalles.

Por favor, tenga en cuenta que necesitaremos la identificación del anuncio de su móvil para identificar su dispositivo en nuestros sistemas.

Other information, like device ids, we retain for our ongoing Services. We will retain your information for as long as the Services are active and after that, for a period which enables us to handle or respond to any complaints, queries or concerns relating to the Services. We will periodically review the Personal Data we hold and delete it securely, or in some cases anonymize it, when there is no longer a legal, business, or consumer need for it to be retained.

Sharing Personal Data with Third Parties

We may also share aggregate, anonymized information with advertisers, clients, customers, and partners when providing our Services to those parties.

Services
The categories of personal information collected by Near’s business services are mobile advertising device ids (MAID), IP addresses, advertising click stream information and location data associated with that device as discussed more fully in our Business Services Privacy Policy. Among other things, we do not collect an actual cell phone numbers or your name, full address or email address.

A sample of what personal information for a device is as follows:

Mobile advertising device id
IP Addresses and general (city or postal code) location data that can be extrapolated from an IP address
Latitude and longitude points
Timestamps with local dates and times and time zones
DO NOT SELL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION
CCPA ensures that Users are provided with the right to opt-out from their personal data being sold. If you would like to opt out of all sales of any personal information we may have associated with your device, please click here to complete a form to OPT OUT OF SALES. The information you supply to us for this request will only be used for the purpose of identifying the personal information about the device which you are requesting and responding to your request (including a record of our efforts).

DELETION REQUEST
If you would like us to DELETE the personal information we have associated with your device, please click here to complete a form to request DATA DELETION. The information you supply to us for this request will only be used for the purpose of identifying the Personal Information about the device which you are requesting and responding to your request (including a record of our efforts).

ACCESS
Certain jurisdictions also provide consumers with rights to request access (correction or portability) of the personal information held about them. We are not able to provide you with the particular file about any particular device because we are not able to confirm who the actual device owner is. We need your manufacturers’ advertising device id (the IDFAs for iOS, and Android Ad IDs for Android, “MAIDs”) in order to identify the device in our systems but we don’t have a way to confirm that the device MAID belongs to any particular person. We do not retain information that would match the device id to the actual owner, so we do not have a way to confirm that the consumer requesting the information is the same consumer that owns the device. It would require us to actually collect more personal information to try to verify who the device owner is, such as requesting their full name, address, and receipt of purchase of the device. Additionally we want to avoid the potential risk of providing a requestor who provides a MAID with the personal information that could belong to another individual. For example, the requestor takes a snapshot of the device id of his fiancée to request her personal information without her consent. If you are uncomfortable with our having any personal information about you, please complete the form to request a DATA DELETION.

Our Apps
For our Apps Echofon, UberSocial, and Plume, you log into the account using your Twitter credentials. We retain your Twitter handle as your account name but do not have access to your password. Twitter does. You can ask us at any time to delete your account on our Apps. Form here.

Please note that all of your Twitter post, timeline, profile and other information reside with Twitter and are not held by us. Please contact Twitter to exercise consumer choices with the information they hold. Please also note even if we delete your account upon your request, but you continue to use Twitter with your account information, that information is stored by Twitter and would be accessible again, if you decide to re-engage with our apps.",Others

Through Partners

Partner SDKs used in publisher apps. Near receives MAIDs, other User data from its partners that utilize their SDKs in various publisher apps.
API Connectors. Near’s APIs are connected to various partners APIs. Such partners share MAIDs, IP, location and other User data through these APIs.
Ad Network Providers. We receive MAIDs and other information about Users from the mobile ad network providers for targeted advertising purpose. For advertising targeted to Users in the EU, UK, and Switzerland, Near is an approved status vendor and participates in the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework (see more at https://advertisingconsent.eu/about/). Legally sufficient consent is obtained using this framework from those publishers whose Apps utilize the framework. In addition, Users have the ability to withdraw consent at any time by contacting the publisher of the relevant App or Site and checking your privacy settings on your devices and with the Apps and Sites you visit from time to time.
Website Publisher Partner. Near receives device information and impressions from its website publisher partner for providing data intelligence services. Our Services may use persistent cookie-like tools such as javascript tag that enable us to measure the effectiveness of the ads served, and for data intelligence about the activities of Users on websites. Users are free to set their consents on the settings of their browser, operating system and device to de-activate the ability to identify their device persistently. Please refer to these settings for more information on how to disable the browser or operating system from receiving cookies and controlling your preferences, including to disallow sharing of device level information or to disable geolocation access.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
ra3,"How does Near use User information?
Our data intelligence services involve best estimate data information and reporting to customers. We use our proprietary tools to transform MAIDs collected, along with approximate geolocation information and other User data, into actionable insights for our customers. Our technology enables us to provide our customers with trend and statistical analyses, such as identifying patterns that will enhance the relevance of ads, providing advertisements to certain types of audiences, identifying and optimizing trade areas and business locations, and for helping our customers make informed business decisions about consumer behavior with trend and movement information. We provide actionable insights, patterns and commonalities to enable our customers understand trends, and evaluate the products and services they offer, such as enabling engagement with audience and enhancing customer experience for an ecommerce website or app.
The MAIDs we collect are stored in our systems for advertising purposes only. Much of the other information collected is further anonymized into aggregated files and use of data points without unique identifiers or only with a hashed identifier. The geolocation we collect is also randomly jittered as another step in making the data less personal. We sell cluster of information which includes hashed device identifiers with jittered geolocation information to customers that utilize our data intelligence services. This information is used in a number of ways to offer such customers, information about business trends, reports, patterns.
A part of the technology retains MAIDs to cater to our US specific customer’s request for targeted advertising, measurement and matching. This data is stored separately from the anonymized data.
Near provides audience curation for advertising, understanding trends etc., but does not create data segments that are based on sensitive personal information (for example, religion or credit worthiness). However, We may create health-related segments such as an inferred interest in diet and wellness, but not sensitive health data such as medical conditions or diseases. All of our customers who subscribe to our Services are required to conform to the applicable privacy laws and regulations as well as our contractual requirements. Near prohibits the use of its Services by others for (a) employment, credit or health care eligibility; (b) insurance eligibility, underwriting, or pricing; (c) unlawful tracking or surveillance of individuals or for generating personally identifiable information.
Our Services also include advertising services that allow us to help our advertising and publishing customers provide more relevant advertising and content on the Apps on our Network. In general, we use the User information collected from partners to enhance our advertising services by providing ad content that is more closely related to Users interests. For example, the information is used to create audiences that are grouped together based on shared preferences (e.g., Sports Fans, car enthusiasts, movie goers, travellers) and to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. Data used to create online audiences is de-identified, helping ensure that neither the ad server nor our cookies contain personal data. We may assign a Near ID in our internal systems for your browser, computer or mobile device when we serve an ad to it or we identify it on a publisher partner’s website or mobile app. The Near ID and other information collected via the Services can also help our advertising customers measure the effectiveness of advertisements delivered via the Services. They enable the Services to determine within a reasonable level of confidence that a computer or device is the same as one with which the Services has previously interacted. For instance, the Services can determine that a computer or device to which we served an ad on Monday may be the same computer or device for which we observed a purchase on Tuesday. In other words, in such cases we are able to infer that a device (e.g. your computer) and another device (e.g. your smartphone) are used by the same owner. Where we are able to make such inferences, we may use this information to deliver targeted ads across multiple computers or devices. This is sometimes referred to as cross-device advertising.",Others

We need your mobile ad id in order to identify any device in our systems but we don’t have a way to confirm that the device mobile ad id actually belongs to the particular person making the request.

It would require us to actually collect more Personal Information to try to verify who the device owner is, such as requesting a full name, address, and receipt of purchase of the device. Additionally we want to avoid the potential risk of providing a requestor who provides a mobile ad id with the Personal Information that belongs to another individual. For example, a requestor can take a snapshot of the device id of his/her friend and request her Personal Information without her consent.

Terms defined herein shall have the same meaning as in the GDPR when used in this notice, except as otherwise noted herein.

Controllership
Within the scope of this Policy, we acts as a data controller for the Personal Data we process.

We may process your Personal Data on the basis of:

your consent;
the need to perform a contract;
our legitimate interests or those of a third party, such as our interest in marketing our Services;
the need to comply with the law; or
any other ground, as required or permitted by law.
Where we process your Personal Data based on your consent, you may withdraw it at any time. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of our processing before you withdrew your consent. It will also not affect processing performed on other lawful grounds.

How We Receive Personal Data
We may receive your Personal Data:

when you provide it directly to us as part of using our websites or mobile applications;
when you provide it directly to us as part of formation or fulfillment of a contract or as part of us delivering our Services;
from third party app publishers and advertising companies who collect your Personal Data through their web-based software applications;

We may process your Personal Data for the purposes of:

providing the Services to our customers;
creating and updating data sets;
providing targeted advertising and content;
responding to your requests or questions; and
sending you email marketing communications about our business which we think may interest you.
Data Retention
For Personal Data , We keep your Personal Data only for as long as we need it for our legitimate business purposes. For example, when we collect information about your interaction with an advertisement served to you, we retain that information for the calendar quarter and then delete it. Other information, like device ids, we retain for our ongoing Services. We will retain your information for as long as the Services are active and after that, for a period which enables us to handle or respond to any complaints, queries or concerns relating to the Services. We will periodically review the Personal Data we hold and delete it securely, or in some cases anonymize it, when there is no longer a legal, business, or consumer need for it to be retained.

Sharing Personal Data with Third Parties
As discussed more fully in our Privacy Policies, most of the information we collect and use is de-identified and aggregated information, such as de-identified categories of app use and jittered geolocation information associated with a de-identified device id. We also provide partners with de-identified mobile device activity in aggregate, except in cases when the actual device id is needed, such as for targeted advertising, and for matching and measurement of advertising. De-identified and aggregated information is not Personal Data, and we use such information in a number of ways for our business intelligence services as we discuss in our Privacy Policy. We may also share aggregate, anonymized information with advertisers, clients, customers, and partners when providing our Services to those parties.

We may also share Personal Data with third party service providers, who process Personal Data on our behalf, and who agree to use the Personal Data only to assist us in providing our Services or as required by law. Our service providers may provide:

payment processing services;
cloud storage services;
web site hosting services;
maintenance and IT services;
customer support services;
analytics and metrics services;
email software; and
CRM software.
Some of these third parties may be located outside of the United States. However, before transferring your Personal Data to these third parties, we will either ask for your explicit consent or require the third party to maintain at least the same level of privacy and security for your Personal Data that we do.

We do not share or use your Twitter handle other than to authenticate your use on our Twitter-based Apps.

Cookies
A “cookie” is a small file stored on your device that contains information about your device. We may use cookies to provide basic relevant ads, website functionality, authentication (session management), usage analytics (web analytics), and to remember your settings, and generally improve our applications, websites, and Services.

If you would prefer not to accept cookies, you can change the setup of your browser to reject all or some cookies. Note, if you reject certain cookies, you may not be able to use all of our Services’ features. For more information, please visit https://www.aboutcookies.org/.

You may also set your browser to send a Do Not Track (DNT) signal. For more information, please visit https://allaboutdnt.com/. Please note that our Services do not have the capability to respond to “Do Not Track” signals received from web browsers.

Access & Review
If we process your Personal Data, you may have the right to request access to (or to update, correct, or delete) such Personal Data.

You may also have the right to opt out of having your Personal Data shared with third parties and to revoke your consent to our sharing your Personal Data with third parties. You may also have the right to opt out if your Personal Data is used for any purpose that is materially different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or which you originally authorized. To submit these requests or raise any other questions, please visit our Consumer Choices and Opt Out Options page.

Exercising Access, Data Portability, And Deletion Rights
You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Data. To provide this information we need your mobile advertising device id (which is a unique id number assigned to each device). We ask you to complete a form and then follow the instructions to provide us with a legible image of your mobile advertising device id. To exercise the rights described above, please visit our Consumer Choices pages. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Data if we cannot verify your mobile device identity to confirm the Personal Data relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use Personal Data provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

We provide you with reasonable access and deletion rights to the Personal Data. If you live in the EU, and wish to exercise your rights with respect to any Personal Data we hold about you, please visit our “Consumer Choices” pages.

We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request promptly. If we require more time (than required by law), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or unfounded.

Changes To This Notice
We reserve the right to amend this notice at our discretion and at any time. When we make changes to this privacy notice, we will post the updated information on our website.

Services
The categories of personal information collected by Near’s business services are mobile advertising device ids (MAID), IP addresses, advertising click stream information and location data associated with that device as discussed more fully in our Business Services Privacy Policy. Among other things, we do not collect an actual cell phone numbers or your name, full address or email address.

A sample of what personal information for a device is as follows:

Mobile advertising device id
IP Addresses and general (city or postal code) location data that can be extrapolated from an IP address
Latitude and longitude points
Timestamps with local dates and times and time zones
DO NOT SELL MY PERSONAL INFORMATION
CCPA ensures that Users are provided with the right to opt-out from their personal data being sold. If you would like to opt out of all sales of any personal information we may have associated with your device, please click here to complete a form to OPT OUT OF SALES. The information you supply to us for this request will only be used for the purpose of identifying the personal information about the device which you are requesting and responding to your request (including a record of our efforts).

DELETION REQUEST
If you would like us to DELETE the personal information we have associated with your device, please click here to complete a form to request DATA DELETION. The information you supply to us for this request will only be used for the purpose of identifying the Personal Information about the device which you are requesting and responding to your request (including a record of our efforts).

ACCESS
Certain jurisdictions also provide consumers with rights to request access (correction or portability) of the personal information held about them. We are not able to provide you with the particular file about any particular device because we are not able to confirm who the actual device owner is. We need your manufacturers’ advertising device id (the IDFAs for iOS, and Android Ad IDs for Android, “MAIDs”) in order to identify the device in our systems but we don’t have a way to confirm that the device MAID belongs to any particular person. We do not retain information that would match the device id to the actual owner, so we do not have a way to confirm that the consumer requesting the information is the same consumer that owns the device. It would require us to actually collect more personal information to try to verify who the device owner is, such as requesting their full name, address, and receipt of purchase of the device. Additionally we want to avoid the potential risk of providing a requestor who provides a MAID with the personal information that could belong to another individual. For example, the requestor takes a snapshot of the device id of his fiancée to request her personal information without her consent. If you are uncomfortable with our having any personal information about you, please complete the form to request a DATA DELETION.
