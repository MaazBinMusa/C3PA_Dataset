I. VCDPA Notice – Consumer Personal Data of Virginia Residents
The Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”) takes effect on January 1, 2023. Under VCDPA, a resident of the Commonwealth of Virginia acting only in individual or household context (“Consumer”) has certain rights related to their personal data, and may invoke those consumer rights by submitting a request to a controller of personal data specifically covered by, and not exempted by, VCDPA.

""Controller"" means the natural or legal person that, alone or jointly with others, determines the purpose and means of processing personal data.

""Personal data"" means any information that is linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable natural person. ""Personal data"" does not include de-identified data or publicly available information.

""Publicly available information"" means information that is lawfully made available through federal, state, or local government records, or information that a business has a reasonable basis to believe is lawfully made available to the general public through widely distributed media, by the consumer, or by a person to whom the consumer has disclosed the information, unless the consumer has restricted the information to a specific audience.

Certain information and data, as well as entities that possess, process or sell such information or data, is governed by a variety superseding legal authorities, and are exempted from coverage under VCDPA authority. For all applicable scope and exemptions consumers can refer to Va. Code Ann. § 59.1-572.

II. Consumer Personal Data Rights Under VCDPA
A consumer may invoke the consumer rights under VCDPA by submitting an authenticated consumer request to a controller specifying the consumer rights the consumer wishes to invoke.

Such consumer rights are:

Right to Access
Consumers have the right to confirm whether or not a controller (i.e., business) is processing the consumer’s personal data and to access such personal data.

Right to Correct Inaccuracies

Right to Know and Opt-Out
Consumers have the right to confirm whether a controller is processing the consumer’s personal data. If consumers find that their personal data is being processed, they have the right to opt-out of the use of it for purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of personal data, and profiling in advancing decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer.
