(“PulsePoint” or “we”) operates programmatic technology platforms which facilitate ad placement for advertisers on mobile applications (“Apps”) and websites. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information on our platforms, and explains your rights with regard to that information. This policy applies to PulsePoint’s platforms and services, including PulsePoint’s ad exchange platform (collectively, the “Platform”), and it explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information on our platforms as well as your rights with regard to that information. Your privacy and your choices around use of your data are important to us. Please read this policy carefully and if you have questions, please email <a href="http://privacy@pulsepoint.com.">privacy@pulsepoint.com.</a></p><p><strong>If you are a consumer or end-user</strong> and wish to opt-out of our advertising, <a href="#info_we_share">click here.</a></p><p><strong>If you are a resident of California or Virginia</strong>, <a href="#section_ca_va">click here</a> for additional information regarding your privacy rights and controls.</p><p><strong>If you are a European resident</strong>, please see our <a href="#">EEA supplement</a> for more information on the lawful grounds on which we process your information and data protection rights as an EEA visitor.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍<strong>INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT</strong></p><p><strong><em>Where we collect information:</em></strong></p><p>PulsePoint operates advertising technology, and as such, has many partners in the ad tech ecosystem that it works with in order to provide advertisements to end users of websites, Apps, and other various advertising platforms and media. When a consumer or other end user browses the internet, that browser or device may request advertisements from PulsePoint’s Platform. Through the serving of those advertisements or through other Platform analytics, we and our partners, including website or application publishers, advertising partners, or third-party data providers from whom we license data, may automatically collect information that is linked to your computer or device that may reflect how you interact with a webpage, the advertisements you view or click, or other information from your mobile device. </p><p>In addition, PulsePoint is part of the Internet Brands family of brands, and is a subsidiary of WebMD Health Corp. Other companies within the Internet Brands group may have access to information collected by PulsePoint. &nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Types of information we may collect:</em></strong></p><p>Most of the information PulsePoint may collect is non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”), which is information that does not identify you personally but may enable us to recognize your computer or device in the future. For example, when you visit a website or click an ad, we or our service providers may collect information such as:</p><ul role="list"><li>Websites you have visited and related information, such as pages visited or the time of day you visited the website;</li><li>Ads served, viewed, or clicked on, such as the time of day of your visit, where the ad was served, whether you clicked on it, and whether you visited the advertiser’s website or purchased the product or service advertised;</li><li>Apps visited, the start and stop time of a use session, your time zone and your network connection type;</li><li>Mobile device information, such as the type and model, software version, manufacturer, operating system (e.g., iOS or Android), carrier name, mobile browser (e.g., Chrome or Safari), applications used and the version of such applications, and identifiers assigned to your device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), Android Advertising ID (AAID), or unique device identifier (a number uniquely given to your device by your device manufacturer), sometimes referred to as a mobile carrier ID;</li><li>Your Internet protocol (IP) address;</li><li>CTV/OTT information about video content viewed on a device or app;</li><li>Location information, such as your zip code or approximate geographic area provided by your ISP or by location services and GPS features of a website or mobile device. GPS location may be shared with us if you have opted to provide that information to us or our partners. We may also infer geolocation of your device based on data collected through, for example, a WiFi identifier;</li><li>Demographic information such as age range, gender, and income range. </li></ul><p>We may also collect Non-PII from third parties that is not linked to your computer or mobile device for use in our Platform. Any information we receive from third parties is used to maintain and improve the accuracy of the records we hold about you.</p><p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information </strong></p><p>Personally identifiable information (“PII”) is information unique to you that may be used to directly identify you individually. We may acquire PII from our publishers, advertising partners, or other third parties, but only where we have contractually required that these third parties have obtained your consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your PII to us. Depending on the source, the PII may include information such as your email address or certain specific demographic information. More precise location positioning, or location information combined with other data, may make it possible to pinpoint an exact location, which in some instances could be considered PII.</p><p>From time to time, advertisers or their agencies may serve advertisements through our Platform that enable you to enter personal information into the advertisement or other form fields, which may allow you to receive more information from an advertiser. In the event that you elect to enter into your personal information into such an advertisement or form field, we may collect such information solely for the purpose of providing services to the applicable advertiser or its agency. </p><p><strong>Health Information</strong></p><p>PulsePoint specializes in health advertising and may collect and use general health-related information when delivering ads, based on interest in topics found on sites or ads that such a user has interacted with in the past. For example, if you have previously interacted with a site that contains information on skin care, PulsePoint may collect that information about your browsing behavior and you may subsequently be shown an ad on another page for skin care-related products and services. </p><p>We also may contract with third parties to collect information that is de-identified for our purposes but is data related to past, present or future medical conditions and treatment of those conditions, including filled prescription data. PulsePoint will never attempt to re-identify this data back to a specific individual. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>HOW WE USE COLLECTED INFORMATION</strong></p><p>We use the information we acquire to provide optimized, tailored advertising and provide insights about an ad campaign. For example, we may use both PII and Non-PII gathered from ads we have placed to provide our clients with ad-related services, such as statistical reporting about website activity and the number of ads served, and to provide more ads to end-users based on the specific website URL, or webpage, visited. </p><p>We also use the information we acquire to serve ads to more targeted audiences as explained below. We consider your PII and precise location information to be confidential information. Accordingly, we will obtain your consent, or, when we acquire that information from third parties, we will request that they obtain it in compliance with applicable law, and where required by applicable law or our self-regulatory obligations, secure your consent to provide the information to us and for us to use and share your information with others as explained in this Privacy Policy, including for interest-based advertising (“IBA”) purposes.</p><p><strong>Segments</strong></p><p>We use the information we acquire to deliver ads to the most relevant recipients. For example, we may develop audience segments (groupings of individuals with common interests or characteristics) and deliver ads to those segments as appropriate, or to websites that we believe are relevant to and frequented by users of a particular segment. For example, if you are a student, we may deliver ads for school course offerings or financial aid. Segments may be based on demographic characteristics such as age and gender, geographic area, and other categories derived from various information. We also collect and maintain health-related data segments to allow our clients to provide these kinds of tailored advertising services to end users. Any health-related data segments used for targeting will not include sensitive health information, such as your actual diagnosis for a particular condition or any of your past online behavior with respect to conditions like cancer or mental health disorders. A representative sample of health segments we use are here:</p><ul role="list"><li>Allergies</li><li>Alternative Medicine</li><li>Arthritis</li><li>Asthma</li><li>Beauty</li><li>Blood Sugar Management</li><li>Bone &amp; Muscle</li><li>Cholesterol</li><li>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</li><li>Chronic Pain</li><li>Circulatory</li><li>Cold &amp; Flu</li><li>Cosmetic</li><li>Dandruff</li><li>Deafness</li><li>Dental Care</li><li>Dermatology</li><li>Diabetes</li><li>Diet &amp; Nutrition</li><li>Digestive Health</li><li>Ear, Nose &amp; Throat</li><li>Epilepsy</li><li>Equipment</li><li>Exercise</li><li>Eye care</li><li>Female Health Lifestages</li><li>Feminine Care</li><li>First Aid</li><li>Food</li><li>Food Allergies</li><li>Food Issues</li><li>Foot Care</li><li>GERD/Acid Reflux</li><li>Hair Care</li><li>Headaches/Migraines</li><li>Health &amp; Fitness</li><li>Health/LowFat Cooking</li><li>Healthy Living</li><li>Heart Disease and Wellness</li><li>Herbs for Health</li><li>Holistic Healing</li><li>Home Test Kit</li><li>Homeopathic</li><li>Incontinence</li><li>Infant Care</li><li>Massage Therapy</li><li>Men’s Health</li><li>Nail Care</li><li>Nutrition</li><li>Oral Care</li><li>Orthopedics</li><li>OTC</li><li>Overactive Bladder</li><li>Pain Relievers</li><li>Pediatrics</li><li>Pharmacy</li><li>Physical Therapy</li><li>Pregnancy</li><li>Health Care Professionals</li><li>Respiratory</li><li>Self Help</li><li>Senior Health</li><li>Sexuality</li><li>Sinus</li><li>Skin Care</li><li>Skin Health</li><li>Sleep</li><li>Sleep Disorders</li><li>Smoking Cessation</li><li>Stress Relief</li><li>Training</li><li>Vision Care</li><li>Weight Loss</li><li>Weight Management</li><li>Women's Health</li></ul><p><strong>Contextual Ads</strong></p><p>PulsePoint’s Platform supports contextual advertising services. “Contextual advertising” is a common practice involving the placement of an ad that is relevant to the content on a webpage. These ads are targeted to content categories only, meaning that a visitor of a webpage sees an ad relevant to the content found on the webpage visited. Displaying an ad for sneakers on a website that promotes running is an example of contextual advertising. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Targeted Ads</strong></p><p>We may engage in IBA (or online behavioral advertising, “OBA”). This may utilize the segments referred to above, and end user data derived from browsing habits on the Internet, to target specific ads to individuals. For example, if an advertiser wants us to display ads to individuals who have expressed interest in acne, sun-care products, or advances in treating certain medical conditions, we may serve ads for those products or services to those individuals based on segment data and Internet browsing habits. We may also serve ads to you based on inferences we have made regarding health-related information that may be of interest to you. We may make these inferences using models based on a sample set of other users’ health records, which we then compare with information in our databases to create datasets we can use to make certain predictions or inferences regarding characteristics that may apply to you, including the likelihood of the existence of certain medical conditions. The purpose of such advertising is to serve ads better related to products and services that may be relevant to the interests of the individuals seeing them. </p><p><strong>Retargeting</strong></p><p>We may serve ads to you based on your previous visits to a website or clicks on an ad. For example, an advertiser might ask us to display a particular ad to people who have recently visited the advertiser’s website. In some instances, a cookie is placed on your computer while at the advertiser’s site, and when that cookie is seen by us on the website of another company in our Platform, we will deliver the advertiser’s ad there. We may also use information collected from mobile apps and browsers to serve ads across devices for the purpose of linking devices to relevant individuals.</p><p><strong>Geo-fencing</strong></p><p>We or our service providers may deliver ads to your mobile device when you are in certain geographic locations. This type of targeted advertising is referred to as “geo-fencing” or “geo-targeting.” Geo-fencing works by placing a “fence” around a certain geographic (“geo”) location. &nbsp;For example, we or one of our service providers could create a 2 square mile “fence” around a grocery store. When you go inside that fence or target area, we or our service providers may serve you specific ads based on your being in that target area. In such instance, you may, for example, be served ads about the grocery store or a product sold in that grocery store. &nbsp;</p><p>With geo-fencing we do not continuously, periodically, or intermittently track your precise location. &nbsp;The geo location of your device will, however, be provided to us or one of our service partners when you enter the target area, and we may also be provided other Non-PII. Geo-fencing monitors an area and sends notifications either to an app you have on your mobile device or directly to us or our service providers when the boundary is crossed, either in or out. Those apps use this location information to process status updates only if you have geo-location enabled on your mobile device. We will not target you with ads based on your geo-location unless we believe you have provided consent to do so. &nbsp;</p><p>If you want to limit or prevent location data from being collected from your device you can adjust this capability through your mobile device settings. Please refer to your applicable device settings for instructions on how to manage your location settings. Additional options for opting out of receiving targeted ads can be found in the “Consumer Choice” section below.</p><p><strong>INFORMATION THAT WE SHARE</strong></p><p>Except as stated in this Privacy Policy, we will not share or sell your PII or any other Confidential Information to third parties. We only share your PII with third parties (i) when we have received assurance from the party who gave us that information that you consented to do so; and (ii) so that third parties may bid, purchase, and target ads to you directly or otherwise use or share that information with others for advertising or marketing purposes. As with targeted ads, we may share your PII with third parties so that they may retarget you as well. We may also remove identifying information from PII (de-identify it) therefore rendering it Non-PII, and share that de-identified information with third parties, such as in segments we create.</p><p>We may share Non-PII with third parties. For example, we may provide information to others as to the specific ads to which a segment of end-users was exposed, or we may make certain information, such as certain demographic information, about end-users viewing an ad available to buyers and potential buyers of such ads. We may also disclose how frequently the average end user requests pages about a certain category (such as health or finance), or which ads a segment of end-user interacts with on domains across our Platform.</p><p>The Non-PII information that we share, including the Non-PII that is not linked to your computer, mobile device, or connected TV or app, does not directly identify you, but there is a risk that third parties who receive such information from us may be able to re-identify you through other information they gather. However, we require written assurances from third parties that they will not attempt to re-identify non-PII to any particular individual.</p><p>In addition to the uses noted in this Privacy Policy, we also may disclose PII and Non-PII under the following circumstances: (1) if required by law, such as by a court order, statute, regulation, rule or through legal process; (2) in response to requests from federal, state, local, or foreign law and civil enforcement agencies, such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, or for law enforcement purposes; (3) in the event of a corporate transaction such as the sale of assets or all or most of PulsePoint’s assets or equity to another company; (4) in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of our creditors; or (5) if we determine it necessary in connection with an investigation or in order to protect our legal rights.</p><p>We may also disclose your PII and Non-PII to our parent companies, affiliates, subcontractors, vendors, and other businesses who provide data processing services to us, or who otherwise process PII for purposes that are either described in this Privacy Policy or notified to you when we collect your PII. For example, we may engage third parties to analyze data or provide marketing assistance. We request written assurances that your information will only be used for the purposes of performing the functions for which we have engaged them.</p><p><strong>USE OF COOKIES</strong></p><p>We collect Non-PII through technologies such as “cookies” and “pixel tags” (which are also called clear GIFs, web beacons, or pixels). “Cookies” are small data files that are stored by your web browser on your computer. When you visit a webpage, the cookie sends back Non-PII. “Pixel tags” are small graphic images (usually invisible) that can be embedded in content and ads on a webpage that track usage of our websites and effectiveness of communication. These pixel tags can then be used to recognize our cookies and to monitor certain user interactions with a website.</p><p>‍Cookies and these other technologies are important and useful because they allow us to recognize your device and remember information about you, such as your preferred language and other general settings. Most of the cookies are stored in your browser, which usually gives you the ability to manage them (though browsers for mobile devices may not offer this possibility).</p><p>You have several choices when it comes to opting out of the collection of information about your web browsing activities through cookies. &nbsp;See the “Consumer Choice” section below for ways to opt-out. You can also find information about opting out on the DAA website.

Changes will be posted on our Websites and the effective date of the Privacy Policy will be revised accordingly.</p><h3><strong>What Types of Information Do We Collect?</strong></h3><h4><strong>‍Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”)</strong></h4><p>We and our service providers (publishers, advertising partners, or third party data providers from whom we license data from) may automatically collect information that is linked to your computer or device and may reflect how you interact with a webpage or the ads you view or click.&nbsp; We or our service providers may also collect Non-PII from your mobile device or from apps on your mobile device. The Non-PII that we collect does not directly identify you personally, but it may enable us to recognize your computer or device over time. For example, when you visit a webpage or click on an ad, we or our service providers may collect information, which includes, but is not limited to:</p><p>• which websites you have visited and information about your visit, including pages visited, what time of day you visited those websites, and more;</p><p>• information about the ads served, viewed, or clicked on, such as the time of day of your visit, where the ad was served, whether you clicked on it, and whether you visited the advertiser’s website or purchased the product or service advertised;</p><p>• information regarding the app visited, session start/stop time, time zone, and network connection type (e.g., WiFi, cellular);</p><p>• information about your mobile device, such as the type and model, software version, manufacturer, operating system (e.g., iOS or Android), carrier name, mobile browser (e.g., Chrome, Safari), applications used and the version of such applications, and identifiers assigned to your device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising (IDFA), Android Advertising ID (AAID), or unique device identifier (a number uniquely given to your device by your device manufacturer), sometimes referred to as a mobile carrier ID;</p><p>• your Internet protocol (IP) address (a unique number that is automatically assigned to a computer when surfing the web);</p><p>• CTV/OTT information about video content viewed on a device or app</p><p>• your location information, such as your zip code or the approximate geographic area provided by your Internet service provider (ISP) or location positioning information provided by the location services and GPS features of your mobile device or website when location services have been enabled.&nbsp; We may also infer the geo-location of your device based on data collected through, for example, a WiFi identifier that the device is connected to.</p><p>We may also collect Non-PII from third parties that is not linked to your computer or mobile device for use in our Platform.&nbsp; Any information we receive from third parties is used to maintain and improve the accuracy of the records we hold about you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), this information may be considered PII (as defined below) under applicable data protection laws. <a href="https://pulsepoint.com/legal/eea-suplement">Please see our EEA Supplement</a> for more information on the lawful grounds on which we process your information and data protection rights which you have if you are an EEA visitor.</p><p>If you are a California resident, or provide us with the Personal Information of a California resident please see the following additional terms:</p><p>You may <a href="https://pulsepoint.com/legal/platform-privacy-policy#opt-out">Opt Out at DO NOT SELL MY INFORMATION</a> And see other disclosures in this Privacy. See also our <a href="https://pulsepoint.com/legal/supplier-data-terms">Supplier Data Processing Agreement terms</a> and our <a href="https://pulsepoint.com/legal/opt-out">Demand Data Processing Agreement</a>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>‍Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”)</strong></h4><p>PII is information unique to you that may be used to directly identify you individually. We may acquire PII from our publishers or advertising partners or other third parties, but only where we have contractually required that these third parties have obtained your consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your PII to us. Depending upon the source, the PII may include information such as email address, gender, or certain specific demographic and other information. More precise location positioning, or location information combined with other data, may make it possible to pinpoint an exact location, which in some instances could be considered PII.</p><h4><strong>Sensitive Data</strong></h4><p>Certain PII and Non-PII may also be considered “Sensitive Data.” Some examples of Sensitive Data are your social security number and financial account numbers. Sensitive Data can also include certain types of information about your race or ethnicity, or information related to your health, such as information on certain past, present, or future medical conditions and treatment of those conditions (sometimes also referred to as protected health information or “PHI”), prescriptions you have filled, laboratory results, and information about your health or wellness, including information regarding sexually transmitted diseases (“Sensitive Health Data”). Here are some examples of the categories of Sensitive Health Data we collect:</p><ul role="list"><li>Addiction</li><li>AIDS/HIV</li><li>Alzheimer's</li><li>Anorexia/Bulimia</li><li>Autism</li><li>Bipolar Disorder</li><li>Brain Tumor</li><li>Cancer</li><li>Depression</li><li>Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency</li><li>Generalized Anxiety Disorder</li><li>Hepatic Encephalopathy</li><li>Infertility</li><li>Menopause</li><li>Metastic Melanoma</li><li>Multiple Myeloma</li><li>Parkinson's</li><li>Pregnancy Termination</li><li>Psychology/Psychiatry</li><li>Schizophrenia</li><li>Sexually Transmitted Diseases</li><li>Substance Abuse</li></ul><p>Unless de-identified, PHI collected and stored by us is also protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”).</p><h3><strong>How Do We Use Your Information?</strong></h3><p>We use the information we acquire to better target and provide insights about an ad campaign. For example, we may use both PII and Non-PII gathered from ads we have placed to provide our clients with ad-related services, such as statistical reporting about website activity and the number of ads served, and to provide more ads to end-users based on the specific website URL, or webpage, visited. We also use the information we acquire to serve ads to more targeted audiences as explained below. We consider your PII, Sensitive Data (including Sensitive Health Data), and precise location information to be confidential information. Accordingly, we will obtain your consent, or, when we acquire that information from third parties, we will request that they obtain it in compliance with applicable law, and where required by applicable law or our self-regulatory obligations, secure your consent to provide the information to us and for us to use and share your information with others as explained in this Privacy Policy, including for interest based advertising (“IBA”) purposes.</p><h4><strong>‍Segments</strong></h4><p>‍We use the information we acquire to deliver ads to the most relevant recipients. For example, we may use PII and Non-PII to develop audience segments, or groupings of individuals with common interests or characteristics, and deliver ads to the individuals within a segment, or to the websites frequented by users of a particular segment, that we determine are relevant to that segment. So, for example, if you are a student, we may deliver ads for school course offerings or financial aid.</p><p>Segments may be based on demographic characteristics such as age and gender, geographic area, and other categories derived from various information, including purchasing tendencies. Segments may also be based on certain medical conditions, such as flu or diabetes, or other medical conditions that are considered sensitive, such as cancer. Here are the health segments we use:</p><ul role="list"><li>Allergies</li><li>Alternative Medicine</li><li>Arthritis</li><li>Asthma</li><li>Beauty</li><li>Blood Sugar Management</li><li>Bone &amp; Muscle</li><li>Cholesterol</li><li>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</li><li>Chronic Pain</li><li>Circulatory</li><li>Cold &amp; Flu</li><li>Cosmetic</li><li>Dandruff</li><li>Deafness</li><li>Dental Care</li><li>Dermatology</li><li>Diabetes</li><li>Diet &amp; Nutrition</li><li>Digestive Health</li><li>Ear, Nose &amp; Throat</li><li>Epilepsy</li><li>Equipment</li><li>Exercise</li><li>Eye care</li><li>Female Health Lifestages</li><li>Feminine Care</li><li>First Aid</li><li>Food</li><li>Food Allergies</li><li>Food Issues</li><li>Foot Care</li><li>GERD/Acid Reflux</li><li>Hair Care</li><li>Headaches/Migraines</li><li>Health &amp; Fitness</li><li>Health/LowFat Cooking</li><li>Healthy Living</li><li>Heart Disease and Wellness</li><li>Herbs for Health</li><li>Holistic Healing</li><li>Home Test Kit</li><li>Homeopathic</li><li>Incontinence</li><li>Infant Care</li><li>Massage Therapy</li><li>Men’s Health</li><li>Nail Care</li><li>Nutrition</li><li>Oral Care</li><li>Orthopedics</li><li>OTC</li><li>Overactive Bladder</li><li>Pain Relievers</li><li>Pediatrics</li><li>Pharmacy</li><li>Physical Therapy</li><li>Pregnancy</li><li>Health Care Professionals</li><li>Respiratory</li><li>Self Help</li><li>Senior Health</li><li>Sexuality</li><li>Sinus</li><li>Skin Care</li><li>Skin Health</li><li>Sleep</li><li>Sleep Disorders</li><li>Smoking Cessation</li><li>Stress Relief</li><li>Training</li><li>Vision Care</li><li>Weight Loss</li><li>Weight Management</li><li>Women's Health</li></ul><p>Our Platform serves both contextual and targeted/IBA.</p><h4><strong>Contextual Ads</strong></h4><p>‍Placing an ad relevant to the content on the webpage is commonly referred to as contextual advertising. These ads are targeted to content categories only, meaning that a visitor of a webpage sees an ad relevant to the content found on the webpage visited. Displaying an ad for sneakers on a website that promotes running is an example of contextual advertising. Many of our ads focus on contextual advertising.</p><h4><strong>‍Targeted Ads</strong></h4><p>‍We may engage in IBA (or online behavioral advertising (“OBA”)). This may utilize the segments referred to above, and PII and Non-PII derived from browsing habits on the Internet, to target specific ads to individuals. For example, if an advertiser wants us to display ads to individuals who have expressed interest in acne, sun-care products, or advances in treating certain medical conditions, we may serve ads for those products or services to those individuals based on segment data and Internet browsing habits. We may also serve ads to you based on inferences we have made regarding health conditions that may be of interest to you. We may make these inferences using models based on a sample set of other users’ health records, which we then compare with information in our databases to create datasets we can use to make certain predictions or inferences regarding characteristics that may apply to you, including the existence of certain medical conditions. The purpose of such advertising is to serve ads better related to products and services that may be relevant to the interests of the individuals seeing them. We may also engage in IBA utilizing PII or Sensitive Health Data.</p><h4><strong>‍Retargeting</strong></h4><p>‍We may serve ads to you based on your previous visits to a website or clicks on an ad. For example, an advertiser might ask us to display a particular ad to people who have recently visited the advertiser’s website. In some instances, a cookie is placed on your computer while at the advertiser’s site, and when that cookie is seen by us on the website of another company in our Platform, we will deliver the advertiser’s ad there. We may also use information collected from mobile apps and browsers to serve ads across devices for the purpose of linking devices to relevant individuals.</p><p><strong>‍Geo-Fencing</strong></p><p>‍We or our service providers may deliver ads to your mobile device when you are in certain geographic locations. This type of targeted advertising is referred to as “geo-fencing” or “geo-targeting.” Geo-fencing works by placing a “fence” around a certain geographic (“geo”) location.&nbsp; For example, we or one of our service providers could create a 2 square mile “fence” around a grocery store. When you go inside that fence or target area, we or our service providers may serve you specific ads based on you being in that target area. In the case of the grocery store example, you may, for example, be served ads about the grocery store or a product sold in that grocery store.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With geo-fencing we do not continuously, periodically, or intermittently track your precise location.&nbsp; The geo location of your device will, however, be provided to us or one of our service partners when you enter the target area, and we may also be provided other Non-PII. Geo-fencing monitors an area and sends notifications either to an app you have on your mobile device or directly to us or our service providers when the boundary is crossed, either in or out. Those apps use this location information to process status updates only if you have geo-location enabled on your mobile device. We will not target you with ads based on your geo-location unless we believe you have provided consent to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to limit or prevent location data from being collected from your device you can adjust this capability through your mobile device settings. Please refer to your applicable device settings for instructions on how to manage your location settings. Additional options for opting out of receiving targeted ads can be found in the “Consumer Choice” section below.</p><h3><strong>What Information Do We Share?</strong></h3><p>Except as stated in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your PII or Sensitive Data with third parties. We share your PII and Sensitive Data with third parties (i) when we have received assurance from the party who gave us that information that you consented to do so; and (ii) so that third parties may bid, purchase, and target ads to you directly or otherwise use or share that information with others for advertising or marketing purposes. As with targeted ads, we may share your PII with third parties so that they may retarget you as well. We may also remove identifying information from PII (de-identify it) therefore rendering it Non-PII, and share that de-identified information with third parties, such as in segments we create.</p><p>We may share Non-PII with third parties. For example, we may provide information to others as to the specific ads to which a segment of end-users was exposed, or we may make certain information, such as certain demographic information, about end-users viewing an ad available to buyers and potential buyers of such ads. We may also disclose how frequently the average end-user requests pages about a certain category (such as health or finance), or which ads a segment of end-user interacts with on domains across our Platform.</p><p>Although the Non-PII information that we share, including the Non-PII that is not linked to your computer, mobile device, or connected TV&nbsp;or app, does not directly identify you personally, there is a risk that third parties who receive such information from us may be able to re-identify you through other information they gather. We request written assurances from third parties that they will not attempt to re-identify non-PII to any particular individual.</p><p>In addition to the uses noted in this Privacy Policy, we also may disclose PII and Non-PII (including Sensitive Data) under the following circumstances: (1) if required by law, such as by a court order, statute, regulation, rule or through legal process; (2) in response to requests from federal, state, local, or foreign law and civil enforcement agencies, such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, or for law enforcement purposes; (3) in the event of a corporate transaction such as the sale of assets or all or most of PulsePoint’s assets or equity to another company; (4) in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of our creditors; or (5) if we determine it necessary in connection with an investigation or in order to protect our legal rights.</p><p>We may also disclose your PII and Non-PII to our affiliates, subcontractors, vendors, and other businesses who provide data processing services to us, or who otherwise process PII for purposes that are either described in this Privacy Policy or notified to you when we collect your PII. For example, we may engage third parties to analyze data or provide marketing assistance. We request written assurances that your information will only be used for the purposes of performing the functions for which we have engaged them.</p><p>Legal basis for processing PII (EEA visitors only)If you are a visitor from the EEA, our legal basis for collecting and using the PII described above will depend on the PII concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.&nbsp; For further information relevant to EEA visitors, <a href="https://pulsepoint.com/legal/eea-suplement">please click here.</a></p><h3><strong>How We Use Cookies</strong></h3><p>We collect Non-PII through technologies such as “cookies” and “pixel tags” (which are also called clear GIFs, web beacons, or pixels). “Cookies” are small data files that are stored by your web browser on your computer. When you visit a webpage, the cookie sends back Non-PII. “Pixel tags” are small graphic images (usually invisible) that can be embedded in content and ads on a webpage that track usage of our Websites and effectiveness of communication. These pixel tags can then be used to recognize our cookies and to monitor certain user interactions with a website.</p><p>‍Cookies and these other technologies are useful because they allow us to recognize your device and remember information about you, such as your preferred language and other general settings. Most of the cookies are stored in your browser, which usually gives you the ability to manage them (though browsers for mobile devices may not offer this possibility). Cookies play an important role.</p><p>‍You have several choices when it comes to opting-out of the collection of information about your web browsing activities through cookies.&nbsp; See the “Consumer Choice” section below for ways to opt-out. You can also find information about opting-out on the DAA website. For additional information, <a href="https://pulsepoint.com/legal/cookie-policy">please review our Cookie Policy</a></p><h3><strong>Consumer/User Choice and Opt Out</strong></h3><p>We are committed to following the online advertising industry’s best practices and complying with the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising, which encourage consumer choice.</p><p>If you are a California resident, or provide us with the Personal Information of a California resident please see the following additional terms:</p><p>You may <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/">Opt Out at DO NOT SELL MY INFORMATION</a>.
