<p>We may analyze activity on the Websites to foster compliance with the Terms of Use. You hereby specifically agree to such analysis.

<h3><a name="6">6. Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a></h3>
<p>Edvisors responds to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminates accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the DMCA (see 17 U.S.C. 512(c)(3) for further information). To file a notice of infringement you must provide a written communication that sets forth the items specified below. You may be liable for damages (including damages, costs, and attorneys’ fees) if you materially misrepresent that the Websites, a web page or any content on the Websites is infringing your copyright. As such, before submitting a DMCA notice, it’s important to consider if the manner in which the material is used falls under the doctrine of fair use. If you are not sure whether material located on a Edvisors site infringes your copyright, or if it is subject to fair use protections, you should first consider seeking legal advice.</p>
<p>A. Notification. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any User Submission or other Edvisors content infringes upon your copyright, you may submit a written notification pursuant to the DMCA by providing our Copyright Agent (listed below) with the following information: (i) an electronic or physical signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that I allegedly infringed; (ii) a description of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by the notification, a representative list of such works on or in the Services: (iii) a description of the location on the Services or Websites of the allegedly infringed material(s); (iv) your address, telephone number, and email address; (v) a written statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material(s) in the matter complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a written statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p>
<p>Edvisors’ designated Copyright Agent for notice of claims of infringement is:</p>
<p>Compliance Department<br>
College Loan Corporation<br>
350 S. Rampart Blvd., Suite 200<br>
Las Vegas, NV 89145<br>
Email: <a href="mailto:DMCA@Edvisors.com">DMCA@Edvisors.com</a><br>
Telephone: (702) 777-8405
</p>
<p>Only notices of alleged copyright infringement should go to the Copyright Agent; any other feedback, comments, requests for technical support, and other communications should be directed to Edvisors’ customer service at <a href="mailto:customerservice@edvisors.com">customerservice@edvisors.com</a>. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the notice requirements of the DMCA, your notice may not be valid.</p>
<p>B. Termination of Repeat Offenders. In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, Edvisors shall, in appropriate circumstances, terminate access, at Edvisors’ sole discretion, of any general user or Member that Edvisors finds to be a repeat infringer of other copyrights. Edvisors may also, in its sole discretion, limit or fully terminate access to the Website or Service(s) of any user infringing the intellectual property rights of others, regardless of whether such user is a repeat offender or not.</p>
<h3><a name="7">7. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Notice</a></h3>
<p>This Website is not directed or otherwise promoted for use by children under the age of thirteen (13). Edvisors does not knowingly collect, maintain or use personal information from our websites about children under age 13. If a child whom we know to be under age 13 sends personal information to us online, we will only use that information to respond directly to that child, notify parents or seek parental consent, and will delete such information from our records. If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. We are not, however, responsible for the collection and use of information by companies or individuals unaffiliated with us whose websites may contain links to ours. Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, we also do not knowingly distribute such information to third-parties. We do not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information via our site.</p>

<h3><a name="19">19. Arbitration: PLEASE READ CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS</a></h3>
<p>A. Most of your concerns can be resolved quickly by contacting Edvisors at info@edvisors.com. In the event that we cannot resolve your concern, binding arbitration through the following procedures shall be your sole and exclusive remedy. Any arbitration under these Terms of Use will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</p>
<p>B. Pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, Edvisors and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to, claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, regardless of legal theory, including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising and claims relating to any and all use of the Service(s), whether brought during or after the term of these Terms of Use. References to “Edvisors,” “you,” and “us” include our respective corporate subsidiaries and parents, affiliates, agents, employees, officers, directors, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services under these Terms of Use or prior agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. <strong> You agree that, by accepting these Terms of Use, you and Edvisors are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</strong> This Section 19 shall survive termination of these Terms of Use.</p>
<p>C. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Edvisors shall be addressed to Edvisors Network, Inc., 350 S. Rampart Blvd., Suite 200, Las Vegas, NV 89145, Attention: President (“Edvisors Notice Address”). The Notice to you shall be addressed to any such addresses, including email addresses you may have provided Edvisors. If you have never provided Edvisors with any such address, Edvisors will, after using due diligence to discover, send Notice to your last known mailing address. The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The Demand must be made within a reasonable time after a dispute has arisen, but in no event shall it be made more than one year from when the aggrieved party knew or should have known of the claim or facts forming the basis of the dispute. If Edvisors and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim informally within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Edvisors may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Edvisors or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Edvisors is entitled.</p>
<p>D. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The arbitration will take place before a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement and must issue a written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which an award is based. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provisions in this Section 19 are for a court to decide. Unless Edvisors and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in Clark County, Nevada. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator unless otherwise directed by the AAA Rules. Each party will bear its own attorneys’ fees and costs. Arbitration fees will be allocated in accordance with the AAA Rules. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator, if any, may be entered for enforcement purposes only in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
<p>E. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief to the extent it affects conduct between a party and a non-party. YOU AND EDVISORS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING SUCH AS A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR MASS JOINDER PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Edvisors agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.</p>
<p>F. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Use to the contrary, we agree that if Edvisors makes any material change to this Section 19 (other than a change to the Edvisors Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice, to the Edvisors Notice Address, within 30 days of the change. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of these Terms of Use in the form prior to such rejected change.</p>
<h3><a name="20">20. Compliance with FTC Guidelines on Endorsements/Testimonials</a></h3>
<p>If you choose to promote our services to the public, including your own personal social networks, you agree that you will comply with the FTC's Guidelines Concerning the Use of Testimonials and Endorsements in Advertising ("Guidelines").</p>
<h3><a name="21">21. Jurisdiction</a></h3>
<p>These Terms of Use and any dispute of any kind that arises with Edvisors shall be governed by the laws of the State of Nevada without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws. You further agree to irrevocably submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in Clark County, Nevada.</p>
<h3><a name="22">22. Entire Agreement</a></h3>
<p>These Terms of Use together with any other terms and conditions or policies that incorporate these Terms of Use by reference, constitutes the complete, final and exclusive understanding between Edvisors and you relating to the subject matter hereof and governs your use of the Service(s), superseding all prior or contemporaneous understandings, agreements and/or communications with respect to such subject matter. You may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you obtain or use third-party content, third-party software or goods and services provided by or through Clients, Sponsors, Reward Partners, Affiliates or other third-parties.</p>
<h3><a name="23">23. Assignment</a></h3>
<p>These Terms of Use, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Edvisors without restriction.</p>
<h3><a name="24">24. Invalidity; Waiver</a></h3>
<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use, which shall remain in full force and effect. It is the parties’ intention that the court modify such invalid provision to give it the fullest effect permissible under applicable law. No waiver of any term of these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Edvisors’ failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
<h3><a name="25">25. Termination</a></h3>
<p>A Member may terminate their membership in any of the Registered Services with or without cause at any time. A Member’s termination of Registered Services is effective upon Member’s terminating his/her membership on the Service’s Website. A visitor to any Edvisors Website who is not a Member but who does not agree to any of the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use should not use any of the Services and should exit the Website immediately.</p>
<p>Edvisors may terminate membership and use of any of the Registered Services and may remove User Submissions in its sole discretion, effective immediately and without prior notice, for any reason, including, without limitation, failure to provide accurate Registration Data; lack of use; or if Edvisors believes that Member or has violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Use.
</p>
<p>Upon termination by either you or Edvisors: (i) Edvisors may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files and/or bar any further access to such files or the Services: (ii) your rights to use the Service(s) ceases immediately, including any rights to contests, games, or activities active at the time of termination; (iii) should you object to any of these Terms of Use or any subsequent modifications thereto or become dissatisfied with the Service, your only recourse is to immediately discontinue use of the Service.

<p><strong>B. Information Third Parties Provide</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We also may collect information about you from sources other than from you directly, such as from social media websites (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or others), other users and our business partners.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to our privacy practices. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any Third Parties, even if our ads contain links to Third Party websites and even if we have an independent business relationship with that Third Party. This policy does not address, and we are not responsible for information practices (including collection, usage, disclosure or data security) of any Third Parties, including any Third Party operating any site or service to which our Site links. The inclusion of a link on our Site does not imply our or our affiliates’ endorsement of the linked site or service.</p>
<p>We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy of each and every web site that you visit to be sure you understand the terms and conditions that apply to you from each of them.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Supplementation of Personal Information:</span></strong>&nbsp;In order to provide certain services to you, we may on occasion supplement the Personal Information you submitted to us with information from Third Party sources. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Address Verification:</strong>&nbsp;If you provide your email address during member registration or otherwise, we use Third Parties in order to verify your email address information registration process.</li>
    <li><strong>Enhancement of Profile Information:</strong>&nbsp;We obtain marketing data from Third Parties and add it to our existing user database, to better target our advertising and to provide pertinent offers for which we think you would be interested. To enrich our profiles of individual customers, we tie this information to the Personal Information you submitted to us. If you choose to link any of your social media accounts to your account, you may be given the option to log into your account using the credentials from any such social media accounts. When you choose to use this log-in feature, we may obtain information from all of the social media accounts that you have chosen to link to your account. Such information may include, for example, your name, date of birth, gender, location, profile photo, interests, activities, likes, check-ins, languages, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number, professional information, contacts or similar information. You may unlink any of your social media accounts from your account by modifying your account settings. When you do so, we will stop obtaining new information from such social media accounts.</li>
    <li><strong>When We Advertise on Third Party Sites:</strong>&nbsp;When you visit a site on which we advertise and click through our advertisement, we may place cookies on your computer or use pixel tags. The information that we collect through this technology is not personally identifiable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C. Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong></p>
<p>We use tracking technologies to help provide content, to measure promotional effectiveness, to offer advertisements and/or other offerings, to recognize you and your preferences when you return to our site, to help us learn more about how our users use our sites, to personalize your experience, to assess which areas of our Site you visit, and to remarket to you after you leave our site.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tracking:</span></strong>&nbsp;We permit Service Providers (as defined below) and Third Parties (as defined below) that we have agreements with us to track you when you are on our Site. When you leave our Site there is a chance that these Third Parties may continue to track you.</p>
<p>A few tracking technologies include, without limitation, images, scripts and subsequent technology and methods later developed:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cookies:</span></strong>&nbsp;Edvisors uses “cookies” and other technologies to help us learn more about how our users use our sites and to recognize you when you return. “Cookies” (which may be html files, Flash files or other technology) are text files that are stored on your browser or device by websites, apps, online media, and advertisements that can be used to help recognize you as an Edvisors user and help store your preferences and activity. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies may store user preferences and other information, and can be deleted or blocked by changing the settings on your web browser. You may also be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. However, choosing to decline cookies may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on Edvisors’ Site.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Web Beacons:</span></strong>&nbsp;Web beacons are small graphic images or other web programming which may be included in our Services. Web beacons can be invisible to you and are used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Sites, to monitor how users navigate our Sites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many specific articles or links were actually viewed.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HTML5 and Locally Stored Objects:</span></strong>&nbsp;Similar to cookies are “locally stored objects” which we may also use for storing analytics information. Locally stored objects, such as HTML5 Web Storage, are used for similar purposes as cookies but typically may contain a greater amount and different types of data than browser cookies. Most current versions of common web browsers clear this locally stored data when you delete or clear your cookie cache. To confirm whether this is the case for the browser you are using, or to learn more about how to precisely control this data storage, please consult the Help function of your browser.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Analytics Tools and Third-Party Cookies:</span></strong>&nbsp;Edvisors uses temporary cookies to help us determine how people travel through our Site. A session cookie expires when you close your browser. We also use Third-party analytics tools (such as Google Analytics) to collect information such as how often users visit our Site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to our Site. We use this information only to improve our Sites and Services. Such tools use permanent cookies to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our Site. Third Parties providing such analytics tools may also transfer this information to other third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on their behalf. By using our Site, you consent to the processing of data about you by a Third-Party click tracking analytics provider in the manner and for the purposes set out above.</p>
<p>For some of our products, we use Google Analytics Advertising Features, including Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting,&nbsp; Google Analytics Demographic and Interest Reporting.</p>
<p>You may opt out of the Google Analytics service with Google’s Browser Add-on that’s available at&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a></p>
<p>For information in general about Google’s remarketing ad campaigns, and specifically about information regarding DoubleClick cookies and how to control and manage Google’s advertising cookies for these campaigns, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/">https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/</a>.</p>
<p>For another Google resource for opting out of Google’s use of cookies, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/</a>.</p>
<p>For another resource recommended by Google for opting out of a Third-Party vendor’s use of cookies, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.</p>
<p>You can exercise cookie choices by visiting&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.</p>
<p>Our Site may also use, on some pages, the HotJar Analysis and Feedback tool. We use Hotjar in order to better understand our users’ needs and to optimize this service and experience. Hotjar is a technology service that helps us better understand our users’ experience (e.g., how much time they spend on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don’t like) and this enables us to build and maintain our service with user feedback. Hotjar uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users’ behavior and their devices. This includes a device's IP address (processed during your session and stored in a de-identified form), device screen size, device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only), and the preferred language used to display our website. Hotjar stores this information on our behalf in a pseudonymized user profile. Hotjar is contractually forbidden to sell any of the data collected on our behalf.</p>
<p>For more information see HotJar's Privacy Policy at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hotjar.com/privacy">https://www.hotjar.com/privacy</a>.</p>
<p>You can choose to disable the HotJar service at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hotjar.com/opt-out">https://www.hotjar.com/opt-out</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Online Advertising Networks and Third-Party Cookies:</span></strong>&nbsp;Edvisors sometimes runs online ad campaigns that display Edvisors ads to you based on your likely interests. We may learn your likely interests when you use our Site and from other companies and websites that help us understand your likely interests. These types of ads are often called “interest-based ads”, “online behavioral advertising”, or “targeted advertising”. We hire “ad networks” to display these ads on websites across the Internet. Edvisors adheres to the DAA’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.</p>
<p>The ad networks we hire to display these ads set their own cookies on your browser and use web beacons to measure the effectiveness of these ads and to understand your likely interests. Our ad networks and Edvisors both learn which Edvisors ads are shown to you, which ads are clicked on, and on which web page the ads were displayed.</p>
<p>Third-party companies may use non-cookie technologies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect and record information about your web surfing activity including your activities on our Site. These technologies may be used directly on our Site. Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these non-cookie technologies, and those browser settings that block cookies may have no effect on such techniques.</p>
<p>For more general information about interest-based ads and your choices, visit the Digital Advertising Alliance at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cross-device and cross-app technology:</span></strong>&nbsp;We use the term “devices” to refer collectively to computers and mobile devices, as well as the internet browsers and other applications on your devices that interact with the internet. We and our customers may use technology that establishes deterministic or statistical connections among related devices (such as smartphones, tablets, and computers) to deliver more relevant advertising to you and for advertising analytics and reporting purposes. This includes cross device data collection which refers to the process of collecting data from separate devices that have been determined through statistical analysis to be linked or related.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How We Respond to Browser “Do Not Track” Signals:</span></strong>&nbsp;Some web browsers or mobile device operating systems incorporate a “Do Not Track” (a/k/a DNT) feature that signals to websites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. We do not respond to web browser and/or mobile device operating systems “Do Not Track” signals at this time.</p>

<p>*Our Site may display Third-Party advertisers’ offers. These advertisers may in turn display their own offers. These offers are not controlled by or made by Edvisors. These offers may be displayed to you based on certain technical information, such as your geographic area or other anonymous demographic information. After clicking on one of these offers, you may no longer be on a site hosted by Edvisors or a partnering Third Party Platform. Edvisors may provide points or other virtual rewards to users in exchange for interaction with an advertisement or completion of a specific activity in furtherance of the advertiser’s promotion subject to our Notice of Financial Incentive. Such activities may include signing up for an account with the advertiser. To properly credit user accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier and anonymous demographic information may be shared with the offer provider. This information is used to ensure proper crediting of your account, prevent fraud or duplicate offers and to resolve any customer service inquiries that may arise. Once you complete an offer, you may then be returned to an Edvisors Site or Service.</p>
<p>In the past twelve months, we have disclosed the following categories of Personal Information to Third Parties in circumstances that are not the sale or sharing of the Personal Information:</p>

<h3>4. Children's Policy</h3>
<p>This Site is not directed or otherwise promoted for use by children under the age of thirteen (13). Edvisors does not knowingly collect, maintain or use Personal Information from our Sites or Services about children under age thirteen. If a child whom we know to be under age thirteen sends Personal Information to us online, we will only use that information to respond directly to that child, notify parents or seek parental consent, and will delete such information from our records.

We are not, however, responsible for the collection and use of information by companies or individuals unaffiliated with us whose web sites may contain links to ours.

<h3>5. How We Protect Your Information</h3>
<p>We take the security of your Personal Information very seriously. Edvisors maintains certain physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to help protect our data. We require all Service Providers to whom we disclose your Personal Information.</p>
<p>We cannot, however, ensure or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Services and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, electronic, or administrative safeguards.</p>

Alternatively, you can&nbsp;<a href="/contact/unsubscribe/">unsubscribe here</a>. Note that even if you unsubscribe, you may still receive transactional e-mails from us (e.g., e-mails related to the completion of your registration, correction of user data, password reset requests, reminder e-mails that you have requested, and any other similar communications essential to your transactions on or made through the Services). It may take up to 10 days to process your opt out request.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opting Out — Advertisers and Third Parties:</span></strong>&nbsp;If you opt out, we will stop sharing and/or selling your personal information in Edvisors’ proprietary database to help Third Parties (including Third-Party Market Research (MR) Companies) or marketing partners send or tailor ads and content to you, including through email, direct mail or online display marketing. Doing so will not opt you out of our marketing partners’ or Third Parties’ databases, only data in Edvisors’ own database – so other companies that we work with may still send ads, offers and content to you. To opt out of Edvisors sharing and/or selling your information with Third Parties and/or marketing partners for their marketing purposes,&nbsp;<a href="/third-party-opt-out/">opt out here</a>.</p>

<p>Consumer Privacy Rights</p>
<p>Laws in California, Colorado, Connecticut, and Virginia provide consumer-residents with specific rights regarding their Personal Information. This section describes your rights if you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, or Virginia and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opt Out Right</span></p>
<p>The right to opt out of:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sales</strong>. A California, Colorado, Connecticut, or Virginia consumer has the right to opt out of the sale of their Personal Information to Third Parties.</li>
    <li><strong>Sharing For Targeted or Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising</strong>. A California, Colorado, Connecticut, or Virginia consumer has the right to opt out of our sharing of Personal Information to Third Parties for the purpose of targeted or cross-context behavioral advertising.</li>
    <li><strong>Profiling</strong>. A Colorado, Connecticut, or Virginia consumer has the right to opt out of our use of Personal Information for profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer.</li>
    <li><strong>Processing of Sensitive Personal Information</strong>. A California consumer has the right to request we limit the use of their Sensitive Personal Information to only exempt uses under applicable regulations. A Colorado, Connecticut, or Virginia consumer has the right to revoke their consent to our processing of their Sensitive Personal Information.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will recognize legally required opt-out from sale and sharing signals such as Global Privacy Control.</p>
<p>If we receive an opt-out from sale and sharing signal and are able to reasonably identify the consumer to whom the signal relates, we will treat the signal from a California, Colorado, or Connecticut consumer as a request to opt out of the sale and sharing for targeted and cross-context behavioral advertising purposes of all Personal Information. We will also disable cookies and other tracking tools utilized by Third Parties on our Site.</p>
<p>If we receive an opt-out from sale and sharing signal and are not able to reasonably identify the consumer to whom the signal relates, we will treat the signal as a request to opt out limited to the Personal Information we collect from the consumer during the online session during which the signal is present. We will also disable cookies and other tracking tools utilized by Third Parties on our Site.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Access Right (Right to Know)</span></p>
<p>A California, Colorado, Connecticut, or Virginia consumer has the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The categories of Personal Information we collected about you.</li>
    <li>The categories of sources from which we collected your Personal Information.</li>
    <li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting your Personal Information.</li>
    <li>The categories of Third Parties with whom we share your Personal Information.</li>
    <li>The categories of Third Parties with whom we sold your Personal Information.</li>
    <li>The specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).</li>
    <li>If we disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose, we will identify the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will provide this information free of charge once per twelve-month period to a Connecticut consumer and twice per twelve-month period to a California, Colorado, or Virginia consumer. We are not permitted to provide access to specific pieces of Personal Information if the Personal Information is sensitive or creates a high risk of potential harm from disclosure to an unauthorized person such as financial information, social security numbers, and driver's license numbers. We will not provide specific pieces of Personal Information unless you expressly request them.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deletion Right</span></p>
<p>A California, Colorado, Connecticut, or Virginia consumer has the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and maintained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our Service Providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies. We may rightfully retain your Personal Information if a legal exemption applies.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Correction Right</span></p>
<p>Please refer to the “How to Update Your Information” section to update your Personal Information.</p>
<p>A California, Colorado, Connecticut, or Virginia consumer also has the right to request that we correct inaccurate Personal Information that we collected from you and maintain. While submitting your request to correct inaccurate Personal Information, we will provide instructions for you to provide us with optional documentation to support your request and we will consider it. We may decline to correct your allegedly inaccurate Personal Information if a legal exemption applies. We may also decide to delete your Personal Information rather than correcting it.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Appeal Right</span></p>
<p>A Colorado, Connecticut, or Virginia consumer has the right to appeal our decision to deny, in full or in part, your exercise of privacy rights by submitting a request to appeal. We will process appeal requests within 45 days of receipt, subject to any applicable exemptions and extensions permitted by law. If we deny your appeal, we will provide you with a written explanation of the reasons for our decision. If you are not satisfied with our explanation for the denial of your appeal, you may contact your state Attorney General to submit a complaint about the appeal results and we will provide you with instructions for doing so.</p>

<p><a name="Right to Non Discrimination" id="Right to Non-Discrimination">Right to Non-Discrimination</a></p>

<p><a name="Notice of Financial Incentive" id="anchor_1678905528731">Notice of Financial Incentive</a></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If you register for our ScholarshipPoints or RewardFish rewards programs, we may provide you with opportunities to earn points that can be redeemed for various rewards such as gift cards, services, experiences, charitable donations, or promotional activities. Participation in the programs is governed by the applicable program membership rules. We may also provide you with opportunities to earn rewards by participating in certain activities both as part of a program and elsewhere on our various websites. Activities that are not part of a rewards program are governed by the Terms of Use linked on the relevant Site. Your participation in the ScholarshipPoints or RewardFish rewards programs and/or any activity is voluntary.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Under the CCPA, the rewards we provide may be considered financial incentives offered in return for your Personal Information. Although some rewards will have a stated approximate value, others, such as experiences, may have a subjective value or a value based on your choices when redeeming them.&nbsp; If you earn points, such points may or may not have a cash value and their value is predominantly determined by your redemption choices. For example, if you choose to redeem 2500 points for a $25 gift card or 2500 points for a digital movie with an approximate retail value of $19.99, your redemption choice will affect the value you receive for the points.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When you choose to participate in an activity, we will inform you of the potential benefit you will gain from participation which may be in the form of points or a particular reward. We will also inform you prior to or during the activity of the Personal Information that you must or may choose to provide related to your participation in the activity; however, the categories of Personal Information we may request include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    Identifiers
    </li>
    <li>Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.80(e))
    </li>
    <li>Protected classification characteristics under California or federal law
    </li>
    <li>Commercial information
    </li>
    <li>Internet or other similar network activity
    </li>
    <li>Sensory data
    </li>
    <li>Professional or employment-related information
    </li>
    <li>Non-public education information (per the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 U.S.C. Section 1232g, 34 C.F.R. Part 99))
    </li>
    <li>Inferences drawn from other Personal Information
    </li>
</ul>
<p>By choosing to participate in the activity and provide us with the Personal Information we request as part of the activity, you are choosing to opt into the financial incentive offered. You may withdraw from the financial incentive at any time by sending us a withdrawal request to <a href="mailto:customerservice@edvisors.com">customerservice@edvisors.com</a> or calling us at (888) 972-1010. Please be aware that by withdrawing from the financial incentive you will no longer receive the incentive offered. We may also choose to treat your withdrawal request as a request that we do not sell your Personal Information.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We have made a good faith estimate of the aggregate value of the financial incentives offered to consumers as compared to the value we derive, directly or indirectly, from the Personal Information consumers provide when participating in the activities to which the financial incentives relate. Our analysis takes into consideration the compensation we receive from third parties to whom we sell Personal Information and advertising revenue we receive for marketing third-party products to consumers based on the Personal Information they provide in connection with the financial incentives with offsets for our anticipated business expenses related to the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of Personal Information as well as our expenses related to the financial incentives offered and the operation of our business.&nbsp; Based on our good faith estimate, we have determined that the aggregate value of the financial incentives we offer is reasonably related to the value we derive, directly or indirectly, from the Personal Information consumers collectively provide when participating in the activities to which the financial incentives relate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Your California Privacy Rights: A Notice to California Users (California Civil Code Section 1798.83)</p>
<p>California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California residents asking about the business' practices related to disclosing Personal Information to Third Parties for the Third Parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternately, businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose Personal Information of California residents to Third Parties for the Third Parties' direct marketing purposes if the California resident has exercised an option to opt out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place.</p>
<p>Any California residents may opt out of Edvisors disclosing your Personal Information with Third Parties for their direct marketing purposes using our Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information form.&nbsp;<a href="/third-party-opt-out/">Do Not Sell My Personal Information (edvisors.com)</a></p>

This includes retention to comply with our legal, regulatory, tax, and/or accounting obligations.
