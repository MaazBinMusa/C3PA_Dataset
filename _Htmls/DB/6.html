<p>Last updated: August 5, 2022</p>
<p>This notice (“Privacy Notice”) has been compiled to assist you (“you,” “your,” or “User”) to understand how InfoPay
    (“we”, “our,” “us” or "InfoPay"), and our affiliates and subsidiaries, collect, use, and disclose information that
    we collect through your use of the InfoPay website, available at
    <a href="/" target="_blank">https://www.infopay.com/</a>
    (the “Website”). This Privacy Notice is part of and supplements the Website Terms of Use (the “Terms”), available
    here: <a href="/terms" target="_blank">https://www.infopay.com/terms</a>.
</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected or obtained by any third party, including through any
    website that may be linked or accessible from the Website. Each such linked website may have its own privacy notice
    and terms of service, and it is your responsibility to review them before you use the linked website.</p>
<p>By accessing, browsing, or otherwise using the Website, you acknowledge and consent to our collection and use of
    information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY NOTICE CAREFULLY. YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE
    CONSTITUTES YOUR CONSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. DO NOT USE THE WEBSITE IF YOU ARE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO CONSENT TO
    THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>
<p>We may revise this Privacy Policy at any time and such revision shall be posted here and accessible via this link: <a href="/privacy" target="_blank">https://www.infopay
        .com/privacy</a>. Any revision
    and/or addition to this Privacy Policy shall become effective and binding on you when you continue to use the
    Website on or after the effective date of such revision and/or addition.</p>
<h2 class="h4">1. Information Collection</h2>
<p><strong class="color-black">1.1 Personal Information.</strong> We do not collect any personal information from or
    about when you when you visit or use the Website. We do not collect, and you are not required to submit, your name,
    email address, or other personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong class="color-black">1.2 Tracking and Aggregated Information.</strong> We may now or in the future use tools,
    including third-party analytical software, to automatically collect certain information about the computer or other
    device you use to reach the Website, without any active submission of information from you. We may automatically and
    through third-party tracking services (e.g., Google Analytics) gather certain non-personal information about your
    use of the Website and store it in log files. This information may include IP addresses, browser type, Internet
    Service Provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and related data. For non-member
    visitors, we remove all identifying information and the aggregated tracking information solely to improve the
    quality of our products and services. Out of respect for your privacy, we do not link this automatically collected
    data to your personal information. We may also collect deidentified, anonymous and aggregate information such as
    age, gender, race, religion, household income for analytical purposes.</p>
<p>This information may be collected via several technologies, including cookies, web beacons, clear GIFs and other
    means. All of this information belongs to us, and we use it to improve effectiveness, content, layout and/or
    operation of our website. You can remove certain cookies by following the directions in your Internet browser’s
    “help” file or through our Cookie Preferences (see Section __ below). If you disable cookies, your ability to use
    areas of the Sites may be limited.</p>
<p><strong class="color-black">1.3 Location Information.</strong> At this time, we do not collect location information
    from mobile devices.</p>
<h2 class="h4">2. Information Use</h2>
<p><u>We do not sell any personal information.</u></p>
<p><strong class="color-black">2.1 How We Use Automatically Collected Information.</strong> The information we collect
    automatically is statistical data and generally does not contain personal information. However, we may maintain it
    or associate it with personal information we collect in other ways or receive from third parties. We will use this
    automatically-collected information to improve the Website and to deliver a better and more personalized service,
    including to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Estimate our audience size and usage patterns;</li>
    <li>Improve the design and content of our website;</li>
    <li>Store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize the Website according to your individual
        interests;
    </li>
    <li>Speed up your searches; and</li>
    <li>Recognize you when you return to the Website.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="h4">3. Usage of Cookies and Other Network Technologies</h2>
<p><strong class="color-black">3.1 Cookies.</strong> The Website uses “cookies” and other web tracking tools to enhance
    your online experience with us. We may store information about you using the cookies on our website. A cookie (also
    called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie, or simply cookie) is a small piece of data sent from a website
    and stored on the user’s computer by the user’s web browser while the user is browsing. We use cookies to improve
    your site experience, to assess content usage, to distinguish you from other users of our site and to support the
    marketing of our services. For example, cookies help determine what kind of content we will serve to the user – a
    use case might be, if a user is browsing a particular set of page content themes, we might serve that theme in the
    form of advertising as we’ve identified them as an interested party of that theme.</p>
<p>We want to be completely transparent about the cookies we use and to make their control as easy as possible for you.
    When you first enter the Website, you will be asked to accept or reject cookies via the Cookie Notice. You are free
    to decline to accept cookies, but by doing so, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of our offerings.
    Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you
    direct your browser to our Website. If you choose not to accept cookies, you may still browse our Website. Certain
    of the cookies are necessary in order for the site to function. In certain circumstances, we may link the
    information we store in cookies to personal information you submit while using the Website.</p>
<p>Further, if you want to delete any cookies that are already on your computer, please refer to the file management
    software to locate the file or directory that stores cookies under the following file names. Other information on
    deleting or controlling cookies is available at
    <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.
    Please note that by deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies you may not be able to access certain areas or
    features of our website.</p>
<p><strong class="color-black">3.2 GIFs.</strong> We or our service providers may also use “pixel tags,” “web beacons,”
    “clear GIFs,” “embedded links” and other commonly-used information-gathering tools in connection with some website
    pages and HTML-formatted email messages. We use these tools for such purposes as compiling aggregate statistics
    about website usage and response rates. A pixel tag is an electronic image (often a single pixel), that is
    ordinarily not visible to website visitors, and may be associated with cookies on visitors’ hard drives. Pixel tags
    allow us and our service providers to count users who have visited certain pages of the Website, to deliver
    customized services, and to help determine the effectiveness of the Website and services. When used in
    HTML-formatted email messages, pixel tags can inform the sender of the email whether and when the email has been
    opened.</p>
<p><strong class="color-black">3.3 Clickstreams.</strong> As you use the Internet, you leave a trail of electronic
    information at each website you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "clickstream data”, can
    be collected and stored by a website's server. Clickstream data can reveal the type of computer and browsing
    software you use and the address of the website from which you linked to the website. We may use clickstream data as
    a form of non-personal information to determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the Website, how
    visitors navigate through the Website, and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. We
    will only use this information to improve the Website.</p>
<p><strong class="color-black">3.4 Advertising.</strong> Note that we may use cookies and other technologies for
    purposes of on-line advertising. This means that when you use the services, we or third-party ad servers, ad network
    providers or advertisers (collectively “Ad Providers”) may use cookies that they collect or that we provide to them.
    Such Ad Providers may collect information about your use of the services (including mobile applications) or your
    online activities over time and across different websites and devices. Collected information may include the content
    you viewed, the date and time that you viewed this content, and the website that referred you to the services. This
    information may be associated with your unique browser, device identifier or IP address. Ad Providers may provide
    you with advertisements that you may see on the services or on affiliated websites. To improve the relevancy and
    help measure the effectiveness of such advertisements, the Ad Providers may use cookies, web beacons, clear GIFs or
    similar technologies. These practices help tailor advertisements that are relevant and of use to you. You may
    control or opt-out of such advertising by changing the cookie settings in your browser as described above.</p>
<p><strong class="color-black">3.5 User Behavior Tracking.</strong> We may track the webpages and links our users visit
    within the Website, in order to determine what services are most popular. We may use such tracking data to deliver
    customized content and advertising to users whose behavior indicates they are interested in a particular subject
    area. We may also collect user data to track the areas of a webpage where users most frequently move the mouse or
    click. These tracking activities make it possible to monitor and analyze web traffic and evaluate user behavior to
    customize our services.</p>
<h2 class="h4">4. Do Not Track Notice</h2>
<p>Many modern web browsers give you the option to send a “Do Not Track” signal to the websites you visit, indicating
    that you do not wish to be tracked. At this time, the Website and services do not specifically respond to “Do Not
    Track” signals.</p>
<p>We encourage you to review the privacy policies of our third-party advertisers and analytics service providers to
    learn about your choices about information they collect from you. In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative
    offers information about some of the Internet advertising companies we may use, including how to opt-out of
    interest-based advertising they deliver. For all the details, including how to turn on Do Not Track, visit <a href="http://www.donottrack.us/" target="_blank">www.donottrack.us</a>.</p>
<h2 class="h4">5. Disclosure and Sharing</h2>
<p>We may share anonymous, deidentified aggregate information with third parties, including affiliated and
    non-affiliated organizations such as advertisers.</p>
<h2 class="h4">6. California Residents</h2>
<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) and other California privacy laws provides California residents
    (i.e., consumers) with specific rights regarding personal information. This Privacy Notice describes those CCPA
    rights and how to exercise those rights.</p>
