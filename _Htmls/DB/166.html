<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deep Sync uses the Information for various purposes, including the following:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>As Part of Our Services</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>Data Marketing Services.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Our Services include providing marketing information to our customers, generally regarding which customers or prospective customers are most likely to be interested (or disinterested) in certain offers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, we help our customers identify and understand their customers better by providing insights about them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our customers include (but are not limited to) agencies, marketers, reseller partners, and colleges and universities.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>Additional Marketing Services.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Other Services we may sometimes provide to our customers (or that they may provide to their own customers), which may overlap with or supplement the above, may involve (a) assistance in targeting and optimizing of direct mail and email campaigns, display, mobile and social media marketing; (b) measuring the effectiveness of online or offline ad campaigns by determining which messages are most likely to be seen or opened by which types of consumers, or which types of ads are most likely to lead to purchases; (c) analyzing and optimizing our customers’ (or their service providers’) proprietary databases; or (d) providing data “hygiene” services, which is how companies update and/or “clean” their databases by either verifying, removing or correcting old, incorrect or outdated information.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>To Operate Our Services</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use your information as a prospect or as our customer to help us personalize and continually improve your query/count and order experience with us. We also use your information to notify you of other Deep Sync products and services that might interest you. We do not sell, rent or trade, or share your business contact information with other companies for their own marketing purposes.</span></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>3) The Categories of Third Parties and How We Share Information</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deep Sync may share the Information with the following categories of third-parties, including marketing services, platforms and service providers that we retain in order to provide the Services we have described above (or other services we may add) and as described below.&nbsp; This includes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>Customers:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;As described above, we license the Information in various ways to our customers (and sometimes to partners and resellers, who license the Information to their customers), when we provide our Services.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>Partners:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;We also may share the Information, including personally identifiable information, with business and data partners for related services to provide more tailored targeted marketing, advertising, and communications. Likewise, we may do so for analytical purposes, including to help these other parties measure campaign performance, inform future campaigns, or to handle, analyze, or segregate this Information on our or our customers’ behalf.&nbsp;<span>Partners may also use the data received for their own commercial/monetization purposes.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>Service Providers:&nbsp;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We share the Information with a variety of service providers in order to operate, protect and advertise our Services and maintain our website(s).&nbsp; For instance, we may share the Information with tech and customer support providers, marketing and advertising providers, other data providers (such as to enhance, perform hygiene on or verify our Information), security vendors, payment vendors (as to our business to business information), and other companies that help us deliver or develop Services.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>Corporate transfers:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;If Deep Sync, its stock or its significant assets are acquired by or merged into another entity, our information will be transferred to that entity, and may be shared during due diligence in anticipation of any such transaction.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>Affiliates, parent companies and subsidiaries:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Deep Sync may share some or all of the Information in our possession with any affiliated or subsidiary companies (if we ever have any).</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>As required by law or to protect any person or entity:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Deep Sync may disclose Information if we believe that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply in good faith with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect or otherwise defend the rights, property or safety of Deep Sync, our customers, or any other person or entity.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>4) Your Marketing and Data Management Choices</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may “opt out” of our marketing database by submitting an “opt out” request via our secure online&nbsp;</span><a href="https://aslmarketing.com/opt-out/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">webform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You also may contact us directly at&nbsp;privacy.compliance@deepsync.com.&nbsp; When you choose to “opt out” through either of these methods, please provide your current address, your email address, and any prior home or email addresses along with your desired request for action.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will acknowledge within 10 days of receipt and process your request within 30 days from the time we received the request, or sooner where required by law.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you would like to opt out of direct mail advertising in general, we recommend that you visit the DMA Choice website, at&nbsp;</span><a href="http://dmachoice.thedma.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">thedma.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The DMA Choice service is managed by the ANA (Association of National Advertisers)&nbsp;and allows you to follow a few easy steps to ensure that your marketing preferences are honored. Many of our partners will only accept requests directly from you, and our&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.compactlists.com/Consumer-Name-Removal_122019.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer Name Removal Guide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;contains the information that you will need.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you wish to opt out of online targeted ads (sometimes referred to as “interest-based” or “personalized” advertising), you can also visit the opt-out portals operated by the industry groups the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Advertising Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;(NAI) or the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://aboutads.info/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA),</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;and you can learn more about how those opt-outs work on those linked web pages. Please note that these online opt-outs are cookie-based.&nbsp; Thus, if you browse the web from multiple browsers or devices, you will need to opt out from each browser and/or device, and for the same reason, if you change browsers or clear your browser cookie cache, you will need to perform this opt-out function again.&nbsp; Opting out in this way will not prevent you from seeing all types of online ads; it generally will prevent targeted ads customized to what advertisers think may be most likely to be relevant and of interest to you.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we market to you by email, in our corporate capacity – such as if you are a customer or prospective customer of ours and we send information about our Services — you may “unsubscribe” from our marketing emails through a link placed in the emails.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>5) Cookies and Similar Technologies</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Cookies and How We Use Them</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deep Sync and its business partners use certain industry-standard technologies, including cookies and similarly functional technologies, which we describe below.&nbsp;&nbsp; (We use these technologies on our website, for instance, and our partners may use these technologies in their own marketing services.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may work with third parties to provide or enhance our services (e.g. for purposes of tailoring ads, or placing browser cookies), or to offer marketers ways to access or use our Information, often in de-identified form. &nbsp;&nbsp;These partners may set and access their own cookies, pixel tags and similar technologies on your device, which may have cookies with varying expiration periods. Those partners may, likewise, collect various types of information about your browser, device, or browsing activities through use of these cookies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies, in turn, are small data files that contain a string of characters, such as a unique browser identifier. Cookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as tags that identify your device. Our (or other companies’) servers send your device a cookie when you visit a website. A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages.&nbsp; When you access web pages (such as the website of a marketer), pixel tags may generate a generic notice of the visit and permit our partners (or sometimes, us) to read the cookies that a respective company or server has deployed.&nbsp; Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to track the activity on a site by a particular device.&nbsp; When you turn off cookies, pixel tags simply detect a given website visit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We or our service providers, and other online marketing platforms that we or they work with, may use cookies to, among other things, “remember” you, determine visitor patterns and trends, collect information about your activities on our clients’ sites, or interact with the advertising you see.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cookies are used in this way to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant communications with ads that better match your interests.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Disabling Cookies</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most web browsers are set up to accept cookies. You may be able to set your browser to warn you before accepting certain cookies or to refuse certain cookies. However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web browser, some features of our website and other services may be difficult to use or become inoperable.</span></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>6) Data Collected Through Our Corporate Website</b></p>

</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you would like to opt out, including requests to opt out of 3rd party sharing, you may do so as outlined on the following page:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://aslmarketing.com/opt-out/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do Not Sell My Personal Information</span></a></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>How to exercise your access and (if applicable) deletion rights</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may exercise your privacy rights by sending an email to&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:privacy.compliance@deepsync.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">privacy.compliance@deepsync.com</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">or by submitting your request through our webform&nbsp;</span><a href="https://aslmarketing.com/opt-out/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do Not Sell My Personal Information</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For security purposes, we will verify your identity when you request categories or specific pieces of personal information we may have received about you. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be asked to answer a series of questions that dynamically present multiple answers for real-time identity confirmation to help prevent fraudulent requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we have verified your identity, we will respond to your request as appropriate:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where you have requested the categories of personal information that we have collected about you, we will provide a list of those categories.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where you have requested specific pieces of personal information, we will provide the information you have requested, to the extent required under the CCPA and provided we do not believe there is an overriding privacy or security concern to doing so.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where you have requested that we delete personal information that we may have collected from you, we will seek to confirm whether your request is for an “opt out” or a “deletion”: because “opt out” or “do not sell” rights enable us to maintain your information for “suppression” purposes – i.e., to prevent us from selling information about you in the future (which is what many consumers requesting “deletion” actually desire to occur) — we try to explain this in order to ensure we are meeting consumers’ preferences.&nbsp; (In addition, “deletion” rights only apply to information that we have collected “from” consumers – which does not apply to much of the information in our databases.)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon completion of the above process, we will send you a notice that explains the categories of personal information or specific pieces of information we were able to locate about you, whether we (1) deleted, (2) de-identified, or (3) retained the information we collected from you in our suppression file. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 14px;">If we are unable to complete your requests fully for any of the reasons above, we will provide you additional information about the reasons that we could not comply with your request.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>Right to nondiscrimination.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;We will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods or services if you choose to exercise these rights.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>Information about persons under 16 years of age</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p>In general, we do not knowingly collect or retain personal information from minors under age 14. We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under 16 years of age in states where state law prevents us from doing so, or unless we have received legal consent to do so. If we learn that such personal information has been collected, we will take reasonable steps to remove that information from our database (or to obtain legally required consent). Where allowable by law, information collected on students between the ages of 14-18 may be used for offline direct mail advertising. For the purposes of digital advertising, all targeting is focused on the parent at the household level for any data related to minors under the age of 18.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><b>Authorized agents</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also designate an agent to make requests to exercise your rights under the applicable law as described above. In order to ensure your privacy and security we will take steps both to verify the identity of the person seeking to exercise their rights as listed above, and to verify that your agent has been authorized, that your agent’s request complies with the requirements to represent you under applicable law, and the agent can make a request on your behalf through providing us with a signed written authorization or a copy of a power of attorney or any other required documentation.</span></p>
