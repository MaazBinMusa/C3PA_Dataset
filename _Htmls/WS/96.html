    <h3 class="ccpa_subheading indented">B. <u>Accessing Your Personal Information</u></h3>

    <p><b>For Job Seeker Accounts:</b> If you are a Job Seeker and would like to access your personal information or obtain a copy of your personal information in a portable manner, you may log in to your password-protected account on the Website, visit the Account Settings page, click “Request Data” (or <a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/candidate/settings" target="_blank">click here</a> to login and be taken directly to that page).

Once we receive and process the request, you will receive an automated email from us that includes a unique code that you will need to enter into your Client account to verify your identity and confirm your account deletion request.

Once you submit your verifiable consumer request, we will verify your identity by matching the information you provided us with information in our systems.</p>

    <h3 class="ccpa_subheading indented">D. <u>Opting Out of the Sale or Sharing of Your Personal Information</u></h3>

    <p><b>For ZipRecruiter.com Users:</b> For more information, or to submit an opt-out request, you (or your authorized representative) may visit our <a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/ccpa-opt-out">Notice of Right to Opt-Out</a> page or email your request to <a href="mailto:dsars@ziprecruiter.com">dsars@ziprecruiter.com</a>. You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out request. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request. </p>

    <p><b>For Users of an Affiliated Site:</b> For more information, or to submit an opt-out request, you (or your authorized representative) may visit the applicable Notice of Right to Opt-Out page linked from our <a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.global/en/affiliated-sites">Affiliated Sites</a> page or email your request to <a href="mailto:dsars@ziprecruiter.com">dsars@ziprecruiter.com</a>. You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your opt-out request. We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request. </p>

    <p><b>For All Users:</b> You may also use an opt-out preference signal, such as the Global Privacy Control (GPC), to opt-out of the sale and sharing of your personal information in accordance with the CPRA. If you use the GPC, your request to opt-out of the sale and sharing will be linked to your browser identifier only.  It will not be linked to your email address (where applicable). If you would like us to make the connection between your browser and your email address, and you have not yet opted out of the sale or sharing of your personal information, please visit the applicable Notice of Right to Opt Out page, noted above.</p>

    <h3 class="ccpa_subheading indented">E. <u>Making a Verifiable Consumer Request</u></h3>

    <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.  Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account on the Website or Affiliated Site sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.</p>

    <p>We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>

    <p><b>Using an Authorized Agent:</b> If you use an authorized agent to submit a consumer request, the authorized agent must provide documentation or other proof indicating that they are authorized to act on your behalf. For requests to correct, access or delete personal information, we may require you to verify your identity directly with us (for example, by emailing us directly from the email address associated with your User account), and directly confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request. If you are an authorized agent, you may make a request by emailing <a href="mailto:dsars@ziprecruiter.com">dsars@ziprecruiter.com</a> and providing documentation or other proof indicating that you are authorized by the consumer to act on their behalf. The authorized agent must provide documentation necessary (as determined in ZipRecruiter's discretion) to verify the agent has authority to act on the consumer's behalf in relation to CCPA requests.</p>

    <p><b>Limitations on CCPA Requests:</b> You may only make a verifiable consumer request to know or for access twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>

    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative; and</li>
      <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Metrics:</strong> Metrics related to CCPA requests received during the previous calendar year are available <a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.global/en/california-privacy-notice/metrics">here</a>.</p>

    <h3 class="ccpa_subheading indented">F. <u>Response Timing and Format</u></h3>

    <p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing (email suffices). The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.</p>

    <p>For data access requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, for example, through an Excel or JSON file format.</p>

    <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the verifiable consumer request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>

    <h3 class="ccpa_subheading indented">H. <u>Non-Discrimination</u></h3>

    <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>

    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
      <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
      <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
      <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="ccpa_heading" data-scroll-destination="" id="s7">7. ZipRecruiter as a Service Provider</h2>

    <p>In certain instances, our Marketplace Clients hire ZipRecruiter to provide Services on behalf of the Client. In such cases, we process personal information under the direction of that Marketplace Client as a service provider, and we have no direct relationship with the individuals (consumers) whose personal information we process.</p>

    <p>Where ZipRecruiter acts as a service provider, it will be subject to a separate Master Services Agreement, Insertion Order, and/or Services Agreement, as applicable, executed by the Marketplace Client, which expressly incorporates the <a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.global/en/marketplace-privacy-addendum">Marketplace Services Privacy and Security Addendum</a> (“Privacy Addendum”). The Privacy Addendum requires ZipRecruiter to collect, retain, use, disclose, and/or otherwise process personal information solely as a service provider.</p>

    <p>Where ZipRecruiter collects your personal information in the capacity of a service provider, and you want to know/access, correct, amend, or delete your personal information, or have another request, we will provide you with the Client’s contact information, so you can contact them directly. In rare instances, however, circumstances may necessitate ZipRecruiter assisting you with your question or request.</p>

    <h2 class="ccpa_heading" data-scroll-destination="" id="s8">8. Retention of Personal Information</h2>

    <p>Different retention periods apply for different types and categories of personal information. <b>Table 5</b> below identifies the criteria used to determine the length of time ZipRecruiter intends to retain each category of personal information. Once you request that we delete your personal information, we will do so except where we are otherwise permitted or required to retain that information in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
