ZipRecruiter has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) under the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.  ZipRecruiter has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.

ZipRecruiter complies with the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, UK, and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p>

In certain situations, ZipRecruiter may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>

      <p>In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, ZipRecruiter commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. DPF to TRUSTe, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States.

      <p>Where ZipRecruiter processes your Personal Data in the capacity of a service provider (data processor), and you
        seek access, or want to correct, amend, or delete your Personal Data, or have other request, we will provide you
        with the data controller’s contact information, so you can contact them directly. In rare instances, however,
        circumstances may necessitate ZipRecruiter assisting you with your question or request.</p>

      <p>For example, some clients hire ZipRecruiter to send job alert emails to their job seekers who have requested job
        alert emails from such clients. In these cases, ZipRecruiter acts as a service provider (<i>i.e</i>., data
        processor) to the client, who is the data controller. When ZipRecruiter provides services in the capacity of a
        service provider, it acts under the instructions and at the direction of such client (<i>i.e</i>., the data
        controller). In the foregoing example, if you are a job seeker who has requested job alert emails from one of our
        clients, the client will provide us certain Personal Data about you (such as your name, email address, the type of
        job you want, and your preferred geographic location) to ensure that the job alert emails meet your search
        criteria. If you have questions or requests about your Personal Data with respect to the job alert emails, we will
        provide you with the data controllers contact information so that you can contact the data controller directly.

      <h3 data-scroll-destination="" id="s6">6. HOW WE SHARE OR DISCLOSE YOUR DATA<a data-scrollto="" href="#top" class="topLink">top</a></h3>

      <p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your Personal Data and to treat it in accordance with the
        law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your Personal Data for their own purposes and only
        permit them to process your Personal Data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions and this
        Privacy Policy. Below we explain in more detail how ZipRecruiter shares or discloses your Personal Data outside of ZipRecruiter.</p>

      <h5 class="indented">A. <u>Disclosures of Personal Data at Your Direction</u></h5>

      <p>We disclose your Personal Data when you intentionally interact with third parties and when you direct us or intentionally use ZipRecruiter to share your Personal Data in connection with the services that we provide to you. For example:</p>

      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>
          If you are a job seeker, we will share your Personal Data as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>If you apply to a job posting on our Website, we will share your Identity Data and Contact Data with the prospective employer
              and/or their agent of the job to which you applied, including but not limited to, any external Applicant
              Tracking System or any other external systems used by the direct employer to manage the hiring of employees or
              other categories of workers.</li>
            <li>
              If you have opted-in to our Resume Database (where such feature is available), we will share your Identity Data and Contact Data
              with prospective employers, recruiters, and/or their agents
              or representative that are permitted to have access to the Resume Database.
              You can opt-out of your information being available in our Resume Database at any time by updating this
              preference on the My Profile tab of your Job Seeker account.
              However, if an entity has already accessed your Identity Data or Contact Data through the Resume Database or via the search
              results, and copied or otherwise saved your information prior to you opting-out, that entity will continue to
              have access to the information that was previously saved.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are invited to and choose to participate in a video call with a Client (“<b>Video Intro</b>”), your
              Identity Data and Contact Data will be shared with the employer that invited you to the call.
            </li>
            <li>
              For any other purpose authorized by you when you provide us with the information or otherwise choose to participate
              in new features and functions available through the Services.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><u>Please Note:</u> Please ensure that the profile information and resume associated with your account is
        up-to-date, so when you apply for a job vacancy or participate in a Video Intro call through a ZipRecruiter Website,
        the employer receives your most recent resume and/or profile information. When you apply to a job vacancy using the
        “Apply Now” button, you will be given the option to use the resume saved to your profile or use a different resume
        before submitting the application. If you apply to a job using “1-Click Apply”, ZipRecruiter will automatically send
        the existing resume in your account. If you want to send a different resume, please replace the resume currently in
        your account before you use the “1-Click Apply” feature. You will have an account with ZipRecruiter if you opened an
        account yourself, signed up for job alerts, applied for a job on the ZipRecruiter website and/or when you ‘verify skills’
        for another user. You can delete or replace your resume by going to the ‘Profile’ settings in your account. If you would
        like to change the resume you used to apply to a previous job posting, you can go to the “Applied Jobs” page in your
        ZipRecruiter account, and click “Replace Resume” to replace the resume used to apply to a particular job vacancy.
      </p>

      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>
          If you are a Client, we will share your Personal Data as follows:
        </li>
        <ul class="sub_bullets">
          <li>If you invite job seekers to participate in a Video Intro call, your Identity Data and Business Information will be shared
            with the job seekers that are invited to the call.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you authorize ZipRecruiter to send automated personalized invitations or other communications to candidates on your
            behalf, your Identity Data and Business Information will be shared with candidates that are invited to connect with you and/or apply
            to your job.
          </li>
          <li>
            For any other purpose authorized by you when you provide us with the information or otherwise choose to participate in new
            features and functions available through the Services.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h5 class="indented">C. <u>Non-Personal Data</u></h5>

      <p>Where permitted by applicable law, we may share your Non-Personal Data for any purpose not prohibited by
        applicable law or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or any written representation we have made to you at the
        point and time of the data collection.</p>

      <h5 class="indented">D. <u>Sale of Personal Data or Use for Targeted Advertising</u></h5>

      <p>Your privacy is our priority, and we do not monetize your Personal Data by selling it to third parties.</p>

      <p>After you visit our Website and/or use our Services, you may receive targeted advertisements about ZipRecruiter when you visit other websites (i.e., social media sites, search engines or other websites that are unrelated to ZipRecruiter) (collectively, “Other Websites”). This happens because we use third-party vendors to provide you with information about our Services based upon your interactions with our Website.  We also may place third-party cookies and other tracking technologies on our Website to track your interactions with ZipRecruiter ads placed on Other Websites.</p>

      <p>These third-party vendors may additionally collect certain Personal Data about you through cookies and other tracking technologies (see our <a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.global/en/cookie_policy"><b>Cookie Policy</b></a> for more information). These third-party vendors may work with additional downstream providers in their relationship network that assist the third-party vendor in providing the advertising services to us.  When this information is disclosed by ZipRecruiter in the manner described above, it may constitute a “sale” or “use for targeted advertising” under applicable privacy laws. We disclose the following categories of Personal Data with third party advertising partners or advertising networks for the purpose of showing you ads about ZipRecruiter Services:</p>

      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Identity Data</li>

        <li>Transaction Data</li>

      <p>ZipRecruiter, Inc. is headquartered in the United States of America (USA). The information that you provide or
        that we collect as a result of your interaction with the Website and/or your use of our Services is transferred to
        the USA and/or to another country where we have a subsidiary or where we have engaged service providers. As a
        result, your Personal Data may be subject to data protection and other laws that may differ from your country of
        residence. Your Personal Data may be disclosed in response to inquiries or requests from governmental or
        regulatory authorities in the countries in which we and/or our service providers operate. </p>

      <h3 data-scroll-destination="" id="s8">8. HOW LONG YOUR DATA WILL BE KEPT <a data-scrollto="" href="#top" class="topLink">top</a></h3>

      <p>
        Different retention periods apply for different types of Personal Data and in determining the appropriate
        retention period, we consider several criteria, including, but not limited to,
        the purpose for which we hold your Personal Data, our legal, accounting, reporting and/or regulatory obligations
        in relation to that Personal Data
        (e.g., financial or tax reporting obligations), whether our relationship with you is ongoing (e.g., where you use
        more than one of our products and/or services), any specific request you may have made in relation to the deletion
        of your Personal Data, or where we have a legitimate interest in relation to the management of our own rights
        (e.g., the defense of any claims).
        In some circumstances we may anonymize your Personal Data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in
        which case we may use such information without further notice to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you no longer have a relationship with us, we will retain or securely delete or destroy your Personal Data
        subject to the foregoing and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If you request to receive no
        further contact from us, we will keep some basic information about you on our suppression list in order to avoid

      <p><u><b>Method for Requesting Information Pursuant to Your Rights</b></u></p>

      <p>If you would like to exercise any of the data subject access rights in the table above (each, a <b>“Rights
          Request”</b>) please send an email to <a href="mailto:dsars@ziprecruiter.com">dsars@ziprecruiter.com</a> with

        request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

      <p><u><b>No Fee Usually Required</b></u></p>

      <p>You will not usually be required to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other
        rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
        Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances and, in such case, we will notify
        you within a reasonable timeframe regarding our reasons for refusing to act on your request.</p>

      <p> <u><b>What We May Need from You</b></u></p>

      <p>Once we receive your Rights Request, we may need to request specific information from you to help us
        confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other
        rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right
        to receive it. </p>

      <p>If we are not clear as to what you are requesting, we may also need to contact you for clarification so we can
        more fully respond to your request. </p>

      <p>If we cannot locate any records about you, we may also ask you for additional information to assist us in
        locating records, if they exist.</p>

      <p><b><i>Using an Authorized Agent:</i></b> If you are using an authorized agent to submit a Rights Request (where permitted by applicable law), the authorized agent must provide documentation or other proof indicating that they are authorized to act on your behalf. For requests to correct, access or delete, we may require you to verify your identity directly with us (for example, by emailing us directly from the email address associated with your user account), and directly confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the Rights Request. If you are an authorized agent, you may make a request by emailing dsars@ziprecruiter.com and providing documentation or other proof indicating that you are authorized by the data subject to act on their behalf. The agent must provide documentation necessary (as determined in ZipRecruiter's discretion) to verify the agent has authority to act on the data subject’s behalf as required by applicable law.</p>

      <p> <u><b>Time Limit to Respond</b></u></p>

      <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within the timeframes required under applicable law. Occasionally it
        may take us longer than the time period required under applicable law if your request is particularly complex or
        you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you as to the reason for the delay.</p>

      <p>As you interact with our Website, we may automatically collect Technical Data and Usage Data about your
        equipment, browsing actions and patterns. We collect this Personal Data and Non-Personal Data by using cookies,
        server logs and other similar technologies. We may also receive Technical Data and Usage Data about you if you
        visit other websites employing our cookies and other Tracking Technologies (defined below). For more information
        regarding our use of Tracking Technologies, please refer to “Cookies and Similar Technologies” below.</p>

      <h5 class="indented">C. <u>Third Parties</u></h5>

      <p>We may receive Personal Data in the form of Technical Data and Usage Data about you from various third-parties
        such as analytics providers or advertising networks.</p>

      <h5 class="indented">D. <u>ZipRecruiter as a Data Processor</u></h5>

      <p>In certain instances, ZipRecruiter acts as a data processor to its clients and is provided Personal Data by such
        clients <b>(</b><i>i.e</i>., <b>the data controller)</b>. In such case, we process Personal Data under the
        direction of that client <b>(the data controller)</b> and have no direct relationship with the individuals
        <b>(data subjects)</b> whose Personal Data we process. </p>

      <p>Where ZipRecruiter processes your Personal Data in the capacity of a data processor, and you seek access, or want
        to correct, amend, or delete your Personal Data, or have other requests, we will provide you with the data
        controller’s contact information, so you can contact them directly. In rare instances, however, circumstances may
        necessitate ZipRecruiter to assist you with your question or request. </p>

      <p>For example, some clients hire ZipRecruiter to send job alert emails to job seekers who have requested job alert
        emails from such clients. In these cases, ZipRecruiter acts as a data processor to the client, who is the data
        controller. When ZipRecruiter provides services in the capacity of a data processor, it acts under the
        instructions and at the direction of such client <b>(</b><i>i.e</i>., <b>the data controller)</b>. In the
        foregoing example, if you are a job seeker who has requested job alert emails from one of our clients, the client
        will provide us certain Personal Data about you (such as your name, email address, the type of job you want, and
        your preferred geographic location) to ensure that the job alert emails meet your search criteria. If you have
        questions or requests about your Personal Data with respect to the job alert emails, we will provide you with the
        data controllers contact information so that you can contact the data controller directly. </p>

      <p>Where we provide services in the capacity of a data processor, we may need to share your Personal Data with
        subprocessors that help us provide services to you on behalf of our data controller clients. Transfers to such
        subprocessor are addressed in the contracts we have with the subprocessors and the data controller clients that
        originally provided your Personal Data to us.</p>

      <p>Personal Data that we process as a data processor is retained by us only for the duration required to service the
        data controller client, and/or in accordance with the instructions from such client, and/or as necessary to comply
        with our legal obligations.</p>

        <p>(b) <b>‘Performance of Contract’</b> means processing your Personal Data where it is necessary for the

          Where we rely on your consent to use your Personal Data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any
          time. You can do this by contacting us at <a href="dsars@ziprecruiter.com">dsars@ziprecruiter.com</a>. However,
          this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you
          withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if
          this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>

      <p>We use automated decision-making to help improve our products and services to you. For example, we may use
        automated technologies to send you job alert emails regarding roles that may be of interest to you based upon your
        search criteria (if you have consented to receive job alert emails directly from ZipRecruiter, in our capacity as
        a data controller), show you jobs that may be of interest to you based on your searches while you are using

      <h3 data-scroll-destination="" id="s6_EU">6. HOW WE SHARE OR DISCLOSE YOUR DATA<a data-scrollto="" href="#top" class="topLink">top</a></h3>

      <p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your Personal Data and to treat it in accordance with the
        law. We do not allow our third-party data processors to use your Personal Data for their own purposes and only
        permit them to process your Personal Data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions and this
        Privacy Policy. Below we explain in more detail how ZipRecruiter shares or discloses your Personal Data outside of ZipRecruiter.</p>

      <h5 class="indented">A. <u>Disclosures of Personal Data at Your Direction</u></h5>

      <p>We disclose your Personal Data when you intentionally interact with third parties and when you direct us or intentionally use ZipRecruiter to share your Personal Data in connection with the services that we provide to you. For example:</p>

      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>
          If you are a job seeker, we will share your Personal Data as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>If you apply to a job posting on our Website, we will share your Identity Data and Contact Data with the prospective employer and/or their agent of the job to which you applied, including but not limited to, any external Applicant Tracking System or any other external system used by the direct employer to manage the hiring of employees or other categories of workers. </li>
            <li>For any other purpose authorized by you when you provide us with the information or otherwise choose to participate in new features and functions available through the Services.</li>
          </ul>

          <u>Please Note:</u> Please ensure that the profile information and CV associated with your account is up-to-date, so when you apply for a job vacancy through a Job Seeker User Website, the employer receives your most recent CV. When you apply to a job vacancy, you will be given the option to use the CV saved in your account or upload a different CV before submitting the application. You can delete or replace your CV by going to (1) the ‘Profile’ settings in your account on the Job Seeker User Website; or (2) going to the ‘Account’ icon in the mobile app (if you are a mobile app user in the U.K.).
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are a Client, we will share your Personal Data as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>If you authorize ZipRecruiter to send automated personalized invitations or other communications to candidates on your behalf, your Identity Data and Business Information will be shared with candidates that are invited to connect with you and/or apply to your job.</li>
            <li>For any other purpose authorized by you when you provide us with the information or otherwise choose to participate in new features and functions available through the Services.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5 class="indented">B. <u>Disclosures of Personal Data for a Business Need or Other Purpose</u></h5>

      <p>We describe in detail below how ZipRecruiter may share or disclose Personal Data with third parties:</p>

      <p><span class="legal_ul"><b>Internal Parties</b></span></p>

      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><b>With the ZipRecruiter Group:</b> We may disclose your Personal Data to companies within our corporate family that comprise the ZipRecruiter Group.  Access to your Personal Data will be controlled and only granted where necessary to provide our services to you and/or to allow us to perform any necessary or legitimate functions.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><span class="legal_ul"><b>External Third-Parties</b></span></p>

      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><b>Service Providers, vendors, and contractors:</b> We may disclose your Personal Data to service providers, vendors, or independent contractors that we use to support our business and/or help provide our services to you, including, but not limited to, third-parties that host our Website, assist us to verify your identity, perform website and platform maintenance, risk assessments, and security, perform data and web analytics, provide databases, IT services, customer service, payment platforms and credit card processing, communication services, and email services.</li>

        <li>
          <b>Third Parties for a Specific Business Purpose:</b> We may disclose Personal Data to carry out specific business purposes. For example:
          <ul>
            <li>Fraud prevention and identity verification services where we believe that disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of ZipRecruiter, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with third-parties for the purposes of fraud detection and prevention and credit risk reduction.</li>
            <li>To enforce our <a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.global/en/terms"><b>Terms of Use</b></a> and other agreements with you, to respond to, and defend ourselves against, claims asserted against us, to protect the rights, property, or safety of ZipRecruiter, our services, customers or others, or to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or for debt collection.</li>
            <li>For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Third Parties for Purposes of a Business Transfer:</b> We may disclose Personal Data in connection with or during negotiations of any proposed or actual financing, merger, purchase, sale, sale or transfer of some or all of our assets or stock, joint venture, or any other type of financing, acquisition or business combination of our company(ies), or all or any portion of our assets, or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another company, including without limitation in the event of a  divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other event, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding.  In the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets or stock, Personal Data that we hold about our clients and users of our services will be one of the assets that will be transferred.  If a change happens to our business, the new owners may only use your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li><b>Third Parties with Your Consent:</b> We may disclose Personal Data to third parties, where you have expressly consented to the disclosure of your Personal Data.</li>
        <li><b>Government Entities:</b> We may disclose Personal Data to law enforcement agencies, courts, supervisory authorities, regulatory bodies and certain other third-parties, to the extent that we are permitted or required to do so by law, or in order to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, or in the interests of national security, or to respond to verified requests relating to a criminal investigation or alleged or suspected illegal activity. This may also include taxing authorities, such as the Internal Revenue Service and other authorities acting as processors based in the United States, the U.K. and other applicable countries, who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5 class="indented">C. <u>Non-Personal Data</u></h5>

      <p>Where permitted by applicable law, we may share your Non-Personal Data for any purpose not prohibited by
        applicable law or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or any written representation we have made to you at the
        point and time of the data collection.</p>

      <h3 data-scroll-destination="" id="s7_EU">7. WHERE YOUR DATA IS TRANSFERRED&nbsp;<a data-scrollto="" href="#top" class="topLink">top</a></h3>

      <p>ZipRecruiter, Inc. is headquartered in the United States of America (USA). </p>

      <p>
        The information that you provide or that we collect as a result of your interaction with the Website and/or your
        use of our services on the Website is transferred to the USA and/or to another country where we have a subsidiary
        or where we have engaged data processors or subprocessors. Some countries that are not located within the EU or
        U.K. may be recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection. For transfers
        from the EU or U.K. to countries not considered as adequate by the European Commission, we have put in place
        measures, including by ensuring that the recipient is bound by EU Standard Contractual Clauses, to protect your
        Personal Data, which can be found at <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en</a>.
        When we transfer Personal Data from the EU, U.K., or Switzerland to the USA, we also adhere to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework with UK Extension, and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (collectively, the “<u>Data Privacy Framework</u>”) and the Data Privacy Framework Principles, as described in our Data Privacy Framework certification, which you can find at <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search/participant-detail?id=a2zt0000000TNnuAAG&amp;status=Active" target="_blank">https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search/participant-detail?id=a2zt0000000TNnuAAG&amp;status=Active</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 data-scroll-destination="" id="s8_EU">8. How long your data will be kept&nbsp;<a data-scrollto="" href="#top" class="topLink">top</a></h3>

      <p>
        Different retention periods apply for different types of Personal Data and in determining the appropriate
        retention period, we consider several criteria, including, but not limited to,
        the purpose for which we hold your Personal Data, our legal, accounting, reporting and/or regulatory obligations
        in relation to that Personal Data
        (e.g., financial or tax reporting obligations), whether our relationship with you is ongoing (e.g., where you use
        more than one of our products and/or services), any specific request you may have made in relation to the deletion
        of your Personal Data, or where we have a legitimate interest in relation to the management of our own rights
        (e.g., the defense of any claims).
        In some circumstances we may anonymize your Personal Data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in
        which case we may use such information without further notice to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you no longer have a relationship with us, we will retain or securely delete or destroy your Personal Data
        subject to the foregoing and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If you request to receive no
        further contact from us, we will keep some basic information about you on our suppression list in order to avoid
        sending you unwanted materials in the future.

      <p>Upon request, ZipRecruiter will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your Personal

      <p>You will not usually be required to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other

        Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances<span class="s8"> and, in such

      <p>Once we receive your Rights Request, we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your
        identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a
        security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. </p>
      <p>If we are not clear as to what you are requesting, we may also need to contact you for clarification so we can
        more fully respond to your request. </p>

          advertising on other sites. Our third-party partners may use </span> cookies or similar technologies in order to
        provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of any

      <p>We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on
        your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur
        within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and the application from which your information was
        downloaded.</p>

      <p>We use email pixels to track whether our marketing emails are opened so that we can understand the effectiveness
        of our email marketing campaigns. To analyze the effectiveness of pixels used in our email marketing campaigns, we
        will remove your email address from the process we undertake in connection with this analysis.  If you wish to block
        email pixels, you will need to use the function offered by most email providers which prevents your emails from
        automatically loading images.</p>

      <p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to
        update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of
        communications, you may turn them off at the device level. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will
        need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification
        information.</p>
