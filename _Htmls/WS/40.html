<!-- dataLayer for Google Tag Manager -->
<!-- Docs: https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/devguide -->
<script>
  // GTM uses a global variable `dataLayer` to manage variables and events.

  // To expose a variable to GTM for use in a tag, do this:
  //    dataLayer.push({ myVarName: 'myVarValue' });
  //
  // When exposing a variable:
  // * Explicitly call it out & expose it in isolation (ie not inside an object).
  // * There should be **no js** required in GTM to access / extract variables.
  // * Pick up new var by creating an associated DataLayer Variable in the GTM admin panel.

  // To dispatch an event to GTM, push the event name and any pertinent values:
  //    dataLayer.push({
  //      event: 'product_outbound_click',
  //      productName: 'chase_cool_card',
  //    });
  //
  // About events:
  // * Tags in GTM can be set up to fire when a certain event is pushed into the dataLayer.
  // * Set up new event by creating an associated Trigger in the GTM admin panel.

  // More on the dataLayer
  // * `dataLayer` is enhanced by GTM and should be declared before GTM is instantiated, not after.
  // * We always use `push` to add values. This avoids accidentally replacing a previously defined dataLayer.

  dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  dataLayer.push({
    // taxonomy values are templated because we can get them server side
