Program purchases, as                                 reflected in AutoZone records, shall be deemed correct and AutoZone reserves the right                                 to determine the qualification for any transaction and to correct or modify the credit                                 or Reward amount at any time based on AutoZone records and calculation of account                                 information. d. AutoZone is not responsible for lost or missing communications,                                 including Rewards, due to Member's failure to maintain current address or other contact                                 information with AutoZone. e. By enrolling in the Program, Member acknowledges and                                 agrees to receive advertising, marketing materials and other communications from                                 AutoZone, including, but not limited to emails. f. Program rules are void only to the                                 extent prohibited by law. g. Taxes on Rewards may apply where required by law. Any tax                                 liability, including disclosure, is the sole responsibility of the Member. h. From time                                 to time, Rewards balances and values will be updated in the Program. Please check the                                 Program website <a href="https://www.autozone.com/rewards">(www.AutoZone.com/Rewards)</a> for the most                                 up-to-date account balances. i. AutoZone may waive compliance with these Terms and                                 Conditions in its sole discretion and may run promotions from time to time that provide                                 enhanced benefits to select Members. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AutoZone's failure                                 to exercise any of its rights under these Program Rules or its delay in enforcing or                                 exercising any of those rights shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. j.

You agree that the requirements of this Dispute Resolution section 5 will apply even to                                 matters that may have arisen before you accepted these Terms and Conditions or the                                 Privacy Policy.

Front St., Memphis, TN 38103, Attention; Legal                                 Department. You agree that You will not take any legal action, including filing a                                 lawsuit or demanding arbitration, until 10 business days after You send a Demand. This                                 informal dispute resolution is in addition to, and does not waive, excuse, or supersede                                 any pre-suit resolution process required by state or federal law before filing                                 suit.<br><br> If the disagreement stated in the Demand is not resolved to your                                 satisfaction within 10 business days after it is received, and You intend on taking                                 legal action, you agrees that you will file a demand for arbitration with the American                                 Arbitration Association (“AAA” or the “Arbitrator”). Sponsor agrees that it will submit                                 any and all disputes with You to arbitration before the Arbitrator. This arbitration                                 provision limits your ability and the ability of Sponsor to litigate claims in court and                                 you and Sponsor each agree to waive your respective rights to a jury trial.<br><br> For                                 any such filing of a demand for arbitration, you must provide proper service under the                                 rules of the Arbitrator and notice to the Notice Address may not be sufficient. If, for                                 any reason, the AAA is unable to conduct the arbitration, you may file your case with                                 any national arbitration company. The Arbitrator shall apply the AAA Consumer                                 Arbitration Rules effective September 1, 2014, available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer-Rules-Web_0.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer-Rules-Web_0.pdf</a>                                 (and as may be amended) and as modified by the agreement to arbitrate in this Dispute                                 Resolution section. You agree that the Arbitrator will have sole and exclusive                                 jurisdiction over any and all disputes arising out of or relating to the Program or any                                 disputes with the Program's Sponsor including, but not limited to, disputes as to the                                 interpretation or application of this Dispute Resolution section or the validity of the                                 arbitration agreement herein. The Arbitrator has authority to issue any and all remedies                                 authorized by law, except that any requests for the remedy of public injunctive relief                                 shall be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. The Federal Arbitration Act                                 allows for the enforcement of arbitration agreements and governs the interpretation and                                 enforcement of the agreement to arbitrate. The place of arbitration shall be Shelby                                 County, Tennessee.<br><br> You agree that you will not file a class action or collective                                 action against AutoZone, and that you will not participate in a class action or                                 collective action against AutoZone.

Followers irrevocably consent to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the state or                                 federal courts of the State of Tennessee located in Shelby County for any action, suit                                 or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Program. Under no circumstances will you                                 or AutoZone agree to class or collective procedures in arbitration or the joinder of                                 claims in arbitration.<br><br> The provisions of this Dispute Resolution section shall                                 survive conclusion, modification or termination of the Program and suspension,                                 revocation, closure, modification, or amendments to the Program terms, and any aspect of                                 the relationship of the parties relating to or arising from participation in the                                 Program. </div>                             <div class="subHeading" id="footerRewardsProgramRulesSponsor"><strong>6.

Because the security and privacy of your information                                             is paramount, we will ask that you identify and provide permission in                                             writing for such persons to act as your authorized agent and exercise your                                             applicable rights under California law in such situations.

We                                             will also independently verify your identity to ensure that an unauthorized                                             person is not attempting to impersonate you and exercise your rights without                                             authorization.

AutoZone encourages vendors to be proactive in contributing to                                 the continued education and betterment of their employees. AutoZone requires its vendors                                 to provide products that have not been produced using forced labor.

Each distribution center is fenced and                                 access controlled. Further, each distribution center has closed circuit television as                                 well as a security guard on duty at all times.

ALLDATA LLC adheres to the same standards as AutoZone; however, ALLDATA                                 does not receive containers, and within the United States, it delivers a majority of its                                 database software products over the Internet and ships a small percentage of its                                 database software products in disc format via the United States Postal Service. In its                                 Vendor Agreement, ALLDATA requires its vendors to agree to take measures to ensure the                                 physical integrity and security of all shipments against the unauthorized introduction                                 of unauthorized personnel in transportation conveyances or containers.

This arbitration                                 provision limits your ability and the ability of Sponsor to litigate claims in court and                                 you and Sponsor each agree to waive your respective rights to a jury trial.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e For                                 any such filing of a demand for arbitration, you must provide proper service under the                                 rules of the Arbitrator and notice to the Notice Address may not be sufficient. If, for                                 any reason, the AAA is unable to conduct the arbitration, you may file your case with                                 any national arbitration company. The Arbitrator shall apply the AAA Consumer                                 Arbitration Rules effective September 1, 2014, available at \u003ca                                     href=\"https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer-Rules-Web_0.pdf\"                                     target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer-Rules-Web_0.pdf\u003c/a\u003e                                 (and as may be amended) and as modified by the agreement to arbitrate in this Dispute                                 Resolution section. You agree that the Arbitrator will have sole and exclusive                                 jurisdiction over any and all disputes arising out of or relating to the Program or any                                 disputes with the Program's Sponsor including, but not limited to, disputes as to the                                 interpretation or application of this Dispute Resolution section or the validity of the                                 arbitration agreement herein. The Arbitrator has authority to issue any and all remedies                                 authorized by law, except that any requests for the remedy of public injunctive relief                                 shall be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. The Federal Arbitration Act                                 allows for the enforcement of arbitration agreements and governs the interpretation and                                 enforcement of the agreement to arbitrate.

This information may include                                             your name, your address, your account information, and any other information                                             deemed necessary by AutoZone to reasonably verify your identity, to ensure                                             that your information is not shared with anyone impersonating you. Once we                                             have verified your identity, we will work to fulfill your request in a                                             timely manner.

Additionally, we may not be able to honor a                                             deletion request in some situations, such as if your information is                                             necessary to fulfill your order with us or meet a legal obligation.

Because the security and privacy of your information                                             is paramount, we will ask that you identify and provide permission in                                             writing for such persons to act as your authorized agent and exercise your                                             applicable rights under California law in such situations. This may require                                             us to contact you directly and alert you that an individual has claimed to                                             be your agent and is attempting to access or delete your information. We                                             will also independently verify your identity to ensure that an unauthorized                                             person is not attempting to impersonate you and exercise your rights without                                             authorization.
