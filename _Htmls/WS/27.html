<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Third-Party Technologies and Services</strong><strong><em>.</em></strong></h3>
<p>Some of the cookies and similar technologies we use are operated by third party companies. We use third-party services, such as Google Analytics and its advertising products, such as Google Signals and Google Ads, that may collect usage data (using cookies, pixel tags and similar tools) about our Platform to provide us with reports and metrics that help us to evaluate usage of our Platform, improve performance and user experiences, and serve relevant advertising to you.
