ra3,"When you browse our websites and use our apps\nWhen you browse our websites or use our apps, we and our advertising partners will receive some information about the device you are using and about what you look at and interact with. We do this for the purpose of choosing which adverts to show you, as well as to make our sites and apps work properly. It also allows us to diagnose problems with them and understand how they are used so we can make them better. Sometimes, we also apply a degree of personalisation in choosing which content to show you (for example, by recommending articles similar to those you""ve viewed previously).",Categories of Personal Information Collected
ra3," Targeting by Reach\nWe combine the information you give to us (for example, sign up information for newsletters and competitions) with the information we receive when you use our websites and apps, and analyse it in order to help us to understand your preferences and interests. We then associate this with a unique identification number. This is then used to tailor the content and advertising that you see on our websites and in our apps, so it is more likely to be of interest to you. ",Categories of Personal Information Collected

ra3,"The data we collect and what we do with it\nThe data we use for this purpose is as follows:\n\nThe page you view, and associated information such as how long you spend on them.\n\nYour approximate location, to city or town level.\n\nYour email address, name and sometimes username and postcode, which we will receive when you sign up for an account on one or more of our websites or apps, when you subscribe to our newsletters, when you enter one of our competitions or when you complete one of our surveys.\n\nThe newsletters you have subscribed to, the promotions and competitions you have entered and the surveys you have completed.\n\nWe will analyse this information to infer interests, preferences, and demographic characteristics, and associate it with an internal identification number. For example, if our website analytics tell us that you are located in the approximate area of Newcastle-upon-Tyne and you read our online title ChronicleLive (which is focused on local news for that area), and you sign up to receive an email newsletter about football from our national title The Mirror, then we could infer from that you are interested in things related to a local football club or to football generally.\n\nWe then divide up our identification numbers into groups based on the inferences we draw about them. Those groups are called “audience segments"" or “audiences"". So, for example, an identifier associated with Newcastle, ChronicleLive and the football newsletter could be allocated to audiences likely to be interested in football, and events near Newcastle-upon-Tyne.\n\nWe then use those “audiences"" to do two things: first, to help us to recommend content which is more likely to be interesting (for instance, more articles about football), and second to help us to target advertisements when advertisers buy advertising space from us directly.\n\nThe advertiser would never see the actual data that we use – it remains with Reach at all times. All we would share with them would be the criteria we used to target their advert, how many times their advert was shown and how many people clicked on it (but not who), so that they know how well the advert did and we know how much to charge them.",Categories of Personal Information Collected

We and our third-party ad partners may display digital advertising on our sites that is tailored to your interests and preferences so the online adverts you see are more relevant to you.

If you do, then the ad networks will be able to recognise your device according to a unique identification number.\n\nWe then send out a “bid request"" to the advertising networks we work with.
