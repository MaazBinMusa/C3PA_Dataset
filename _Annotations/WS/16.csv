ra3,"Do Not Sell/Share/Target\nUnder the various U.S. State Privacy Laws, Consumers have the right to opt-out of certain processing activities. California and certain other states have opt-outs specific to Targeted Advertising activities - which California’s law refers to as “cross-context behavioral advertising”, and others simply as Targeted Advertising - which involve the use of PI from different businesses or services to target advertisements to you. California provides Consumers the right to opt-out of Sharing, which includes providing or making available PI to third parties for such Targeted Advertising activities, while other states provide Consumers the right to opt-out from processing PI for Targeted Advertising more broadly. There are broad and differing concepts of the Sale of PI under the various U.S. State Privacy Laws, all of which at a minimum require providing or otherwise making available PI to a third party.\n\nThird-Party digital businesses, including social media platforms, analytics companies, data brokers, third-party advertisers, and other tech companies that offer digital advertising services (“Third-Party Digital Businesses”) may associate cookies, web beacons (also known as pixel tags) and other similar technology (“Tracking Technologies”) on the U.S. News Services that collect PI when you use or access the U.S. News Services, or otherwise collect and process PI that we make available about you, including digital activity information. Giving access to PI on the U.S. News Services, or otherwise, to Third-Party Digital Businesses could be deemed a Sale and/or Sharing and could implicate Targeted Advertising under some state laws. Therefore, we will treat such PI collected by Third-Party Digital Businesses (e.g., cookie ID, IP address, and other online IDs and internet or other electronic activity information) as such, and subject to the opt-out requests described above. In some instances, the PI we make available about you is collected directly by such Third-Party Digital Businesses using Tracking Technologies on the U.S. News Services or our advertisements that are served on third-party sites (which we refer to as “cookie PI”). However, certain PI which we make available to Third Party Digital Businesses is information that we have previously collected directly from you or otherwise about you, such as your email address (which we refer to below as “non-cookie PI”). For information regarding other categories of third parties to which we may sell/share your PI, see the table above in the PI COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURES section above.",Description of Right to Opt-out of sale of PI
ra3,"Opt-out for non-cookie PI: If you would like to submit a request to opt-out of our processing of your non-cookie PI (e.g., your email address) for Targeted Advertising, or opt-out of the Sale or Sharing of such data, make an opt-out request on our webform.\n\nOpt-out for cookie PI: If you would like to submit a request to opt-out of our processing of your cookie-related PI for Targeted Advertising, or opt-out of the sale/sharing of such PI, you can exercise an opt-out request by visiting our webform and following the instructions",Methods to exercise rights
ra3,"Right to Non-Discrimination; Incentive/Loyalty Programs\nYou have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment, in a manner prohibited by U.S. State Privacy Laws, for the exercise of your privacy rights.\n\nWe collect and use your PI to administer and maintain incentive/loyalty programs that may constitute a “financial incentive,” “price or service difference,” or “bona fide loyalty program” as defined under the U.S. State Privacy Laws. For a description of our current loyalty/incentive programs, including how to opt-in to or withdraw from such programs, and the basis for valuing your PI in connection with program benefits, click here. Please note that participating in our incentive programs is entirely optional, you will have to affirmatively opt-in to the programs to participate. Additionally, any opt out instructions are available in the link above. We may add or change incentive programs by posting a notice on the program descriptions linked to above, so check them regularly.",Description of Right to Non-discrimination on exercising rights
