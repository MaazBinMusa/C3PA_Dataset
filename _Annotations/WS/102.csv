Providing this information is not required to use the service.\nYour specific activities on or connected to the Change.org platform.

When you are signed in or identified as a particular Change.org user, your activities on or connected to the Change.org platform are automatically associated with your account.\nAny other information you voluntarily submit.	You may be offered the choice to provide other information to us. For example, we may collect information when you respond to user surveys, or when you provide information when we assist you by telephone. Providing this information is not required to use the service.\nThe name of the browser you use to access Change.org.	Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows PC or Mac), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version, and the name and version of the Change.org platform you are using.

That data is integrated into our platform to enable users in the United States to accurately identify the correct decision maker for their petition. We also use this data to match petitions from a particular district to the right political representative.

ra1,"The Change.org community\nAll information you post on our platform (such as petitions you create, reasons for signing a petition, your posts on the Change.org Community message boards, your response to a petition that identifies you as a decision maker, etc.) will be visible to other users. When you provide information to us, you declare that such information is truthful and does not infringe upon the rights of any third party, that you have the legal right to share it, and that you are aware of the risks associated with sharing personal information concerning third parties.\nIf you choose to send messages or connect with others through our platform about petitions you have signed, shared, or that identify you as a decision maker, you disclose your personal information to the recipient of your message. Our platform provides an open forum for communication by users all around the world. We do not monitor, verify, or perform any background check on campaign starters, petition signers, or other users of Change.org.\nSimilar to traditional paper petitions, we consider an online petition to be a public expression of support for an issue. Therefore, your name, general geographic location (i.e., city, state, country), and a link to your Change.org user profile may be displayed on the landing page for any petition you sign, and on related areas of our platform. This information will be viewable to any visitor, including the media, search engines, and other organizations that provide archival internet activities. If you do not wish to have your support for a petition to be public, we recommend you do not sign or share the petition. If you do not wish to have your name displayed on a petition landing page, you may select the option not to display your name and comment publicly on the petition page.\nYour first name, last name, city, country, and/or postcode, and the day that you signed will be shared with the person who initiated a petition you have signed, even if you select the option not to display your name and comment publicly. This is extremely important for petition starters to demonstrate the legitimacy of their signatures to the decision makers they are working to influence. If you do not wish to have this information shared with the person who initiated the petition, please do not sign the petition.\nThe petition starter may choose to share your name and general geographic location with the intended decision maker who is the recipient of their petition. For example, the intended decision maker may be your congressman/woman when the petition concerns an issue relevant to him or her. If you do not wish to have this information shared with the petition recipient, you should not sign the petition.\n2. Your connected social media platforms\nYou may share your activities on Change.org with friends on other social media sites, for example, sharing a petition you signed on Facebook. In such a case, you authorize us to share your user id with your social media account provider, and you understand that the use of the information we share will be governed by the social media siteâ€™s privacy policy.
