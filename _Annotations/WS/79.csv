We may also ask you to tell us your name so we know who you are.\n\nWe may ask you to share some information about what kind of user you are (your role), your geographic location, what and where you teach, and information about your interests to help us personalize your experience using our Services. Finally, some features of our Service may allow you to upload, create, record, post or otherwise add and/or share Resources or other content (“Content”) through our platform.\n\nSellers. Members who register for one of our Seller Memberships (“Sellers”), will be required to provide additional contact information and set up or connect a payout account to receive Earnings. Sellers can choose to use a name other than their given name as a “Store Name.” A Seller’s Store Name, profile image or logo, and any additional information they choose to provide about themselves in their Store profile will be publicly viewable.\n\nTo comply with applicable laws, we may collect federal tax identification information from Sellers, including your social security number or employer identification number, to verify your identity and issue tax documents.\n\nPurchase information. When you make a purchase through our Services, you’ll need to provide billing and payment information to complete your order. We’ve carefully chosen Service Providers who use Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliant practices to process payments (“Payment Processors”). Whether you check out using a credit or debit card, PayPal account, or any other payment method we may support, your payment will be processed directly by our Payment Processor and we’ll never have access to or store your full payment card details.\n\nWhen you use a credit or debit card to pay for your purchases, you’ll be asked to add a credit or debit card payment source (“Payment Card”). When you submit your order, this information will be sent directly to and stored by our Payment Processor. After your payment is processed, the Payment Processor will send TPT some details about the transaction so that we can record your order in our database and provide access to the materials that you purchased.\n\nThe Payment Card you added will be available for future use on your Account. You can edit or remove this information at any time by navigating to the checkout page or by contacting us for assistance.\n\nB. You, For Information Collected Automatically In Connection With Your Use of Our Services\n\nWhen you use our Services as a Member or a Visitor, we receive and collect certain information from your browser and your device such as your Internet Protocol address (IP address), device information, operating system, browser type and version, and browser country location. This information helps us defend against fraudulent activity or attacks, maintain the security of our Services, and improve and personalize your experience.\n\nWe also log data related to how Members and Visitors use our Services, including Cookies (as defined below) that may uniquely identify your visit or account. This log data includes details such as what pages of our Site or App you visit and when, how users navigate through the Site, and visit referral URLs. This information allows us to better understand how our Services are being used, helps us make improvements, and enables us to personalize your experience with our Services. (Please refer to the Cookies section below for more information about how we use Cookies.)\n\nFrom time to time, we may host and provide Members and Visitors the opportunity to participate in contests, sweepstakes, and surveys.

Third Party Integrations may for example, include your use of certain features allowing you to import or export content to or from TPT or linking an account you have with Google or a supported LMS to TPT. TPT may add or remove Third Party Integrations from time to time. Your use of Third Party Integrations is at your discretion and risk and subject to the Third Party Integration’s terms and privacy policies.\n\nGoogle Drive - Through an integration with Google Drive, you may have the option to list files directly from your Google Drive in your TPT store (“Resources for Google Apps”), or access Resources for Google Apps directly through your Google Drive account (e.g. resources that you have purchased or added to your TPT account for free). To enable your use of this integration, you’ll need to give TPT permission to access your Google Drive for the purposes described in this section. If you’re a Seller listing Resources from your Google Drive, we’ll use this access to list in your TPT store files that you choose from your Google Drive account, set file permissions, make copies for each Member who purchases or accesses your Resources for Google Apps for free, and monitor listed files from your Google Drive for deletions, updates, or changes in permissions so we may be able to alert you or impacted Members. For Members who choose to purchase (or access for free) Resources for Google Apps, we’ll use this access to deliver the Resource to your Google Drive. Use of the integration is subject to Google’s privacy policies — you can find more information about how Google uses your information and what information Google shares with us here.\nLearning Management Services - you (or your School) may be able to connect to third party Learning Management Services. See our Student Privacy Policy for more detailed information on what information may be collected or shared when using these integrations.\nExternal Payment Accounts.
