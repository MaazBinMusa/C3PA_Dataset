D. ZipRecruiter as a Service Provider (Data Processor)
In certain instances, our clients hire ZipRecruiter to provide services on behalf of the client. In such case, we process Personal Data under the direction of that client (the data controller) and have no direct relationship with the individuals (data subjects) whose Personal Data we process.

Where ZipRecruiter processes your Personal Data in the capacity of a service provider (data processor), and you seek access, or want to correct, amend, or delete your Personal Data, or have other request, we will provide you with the data controller’s contact information, so you can contact them directly. In rare instances, however, circumstances may necessitate ZipRecruiter assisting you with your question or request.

For example, some clients hire ZipRecruiter to send job alert emails to their job seekers who have requested job alert emails from such clients. In these cases, ZipRecruiter acts as a service provider (i.e., data processor) to the client, who is the data controller. When ZipRecruiter provides services in the capacity of a service provider, it acts under the instructions and at the direction of such client (i.e., the data controller). In the foregoing example, if you are a job seeker who has requested job alert emails from one of our clients, the client will provide us certain Personal Data about you (such as your name, email address, the type of job you want, and your preferred geographic location) to ensure that the job alert emails meet your search criteria. If you have questions or requests about your Personal Data with respect to the job alert emails, we will provide you with the data controllers contact information so that you can contact the data controller directly.",Categories of Personal Information Collected

ra3,"HOW WE SHARE OR DISCLOSE YOUR DATAtop
We require all third parties to respect the security of your Personal Data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your Personal Data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your Personal Data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions and this Privacy Policy. Below we explain in more detail how ZipRecruiter shares or discloses your Personal Data outside of ZipRecruiter.

A. Disclosures of Personal Data at Your Direction
We disclose your Personal Data when you intentionally interact with third parties and when you direct us or intentionally use ZipRecruiter to share your Personal Data in connection with the services that we provide to you. For example:

If you are a job seeker, we will share your Personal Data as follows:
If you apply to a job posting on our Website, we will share your Identity Data and Contact Data with the prospective employer and/or their agent of the job to which you applied, including but not limited to, any external Applicant Tracking System or any other external systems used by the direct employer to manage the hiring of employees or other categories of workers.
If you have opted-in to our Resume Database (where such feature is available), we will share your Identity Data and Contact Data with prospective employers, recruiters, and/or their agents or representative that are permitted to have access to the Resume Database. You can opt-out of your information being available in our Resume Database at any time by updating this preference on the My Profile tab of your Job Seeker account. However, if an entity has already accessed your Identity Data or Contact Data through the Resume Database or via the search results, and copied or otherwise saved your information prior to you opting-out, that entity will continue to have access to the information that was previously saved.
If you are invited to and choose to participate in a video call with a Client (“Video Intro”), your Identity Data and Contact Data will be shared with the employer that invited you to the call.
For any other purpose authorized by you when you provide us with the information or otherwise choose to participate in new features and functions available through the Services.
Please Note: Please ensure that the profile information and resume associated with your account is up-to-date, so when you apply for a job vacancy or participate in a Video Intro call through a ZipRecruiter Website, the employer receives your most recent resume and/or profile information. When you apply to a job vacancy using the “Apply Now” button, you will be given the option to use the resume saved to your profile or use a different resume before submitting the application. If you apply to a job using “1-Click Apply”, ZipRecruiter will automatically send the existing resume in your account. If you want to send a different resume, please replace the resume currently in your account before you use the “1-Click Apply” feature. You will have an account with ZipRecruiter if you opened an account yourself, signed up for job alerts, applied for a job on the ZipRecruiter website and/or when you ‘verify skills’ for another user. You can delete or replace your resume by going to the ‘Profile’ settings in your account. If you would like to change the resume you used to apply to a previous job posting, you can go to the “Applied Jobs” page in your ZipRecruiter account, and click “Replace Resume” to replace the resume used to apply to a particular job vacancy.

If you are a Client, we will share your Personal Data as follows:
If you invite job seekers to participate in a Video Intro call, your Identity Data and Business Information will be shared with the job seekers that are invited to the call.
If you authorize ZipRecruiter to send automated personalized invitations or other communications to candidates on your behalf, your Identity Data and Business Information will be shared with candidates that are invited to connect with you and/or apply to your job.
For any other purpose authorized by you when you provide us with the information or otherwise choose to participate in new features and functions available through the Services.",Categories of Personal Information Shared / Disclosed
