Certain cookies are used for specific purposes that are essential to your secure use and navigation of the Properties so that we are able to provide you with the services you request. Without them, Forbes may not be able to provide core Property functions and features to you, and the Property would not operate as well as you or Forbes would like. For example, they enable core functions like carrying out network transmissions and enabling you to log in to our systems. They also enable us to comply with legal obligations in regions with laws that apply to cookies, like by maintaining your cookie consent choices in regions that require consent or, in opt-out regions, by preventing advertising-related or other optional digital trackers from being placed on your browser or device if you have opted out. These cookies collect and use information such as your server preferences, single-session data and corresponding identifier, web beacons and log files (detailed below), and other credential-related information. Required cookies cannot be switched off on our Properties.\n\nFunctional. Other cookies may be used to collect and process information about your preferences and similar choices in connection with the Properties in order to allow us to provide enhanced functionality, customization and personalization, such as by remembering your login information or other choices or by providing you with more personalized features (e.g., various local preference settings; which geographically-customized version of the Properties and related content you may prefer). Functional cookies include social media cookies, which collect information about your social media usage and other data you may have provided in connection with such usage (if you access the Site through a social media website or mobile application, you may have social media cookies).

This allows us to provide a high-quality experience by customizing our offerings and quickly identifying and fixing any issues that arise. For example, we might use analytics cookies to keep track of which pages are most popular, which method of linking between pages is most effective, and to determine why some pages are receiving error messages.\n\nAdvertising. To help support the Properties and further tailor your experience, Forbes and its advertising partners (and/or their third-party analytics providers) may also use cookies on the Properties (including in emails) to personalize the content and advertisements you may be shown. Such advertisements use cookies to provide you targeted advertisements that may be more consistent with your interests than non-targeted advertisements. Certain Forbes advertising partners may also use cookies to monitor or track the performance of their advertising content, including native advertising content (e.g., BrandVoice), including how you interact with the advertising content, even in situations where the ad is displayed on another site.
