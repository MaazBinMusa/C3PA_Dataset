We collect IP addresses, identifiers from the devices you might use to connect, and characteristics about the networks you use when you connect to our service online (see also “Information we collect automatically” above in the Privacy Statement). These sorts of identifiers are connected to your Netflix account. There are also identifiers we use for purposes like advertising (resettable device identifiers, third party advertising cookies on our website) that we do not associate with your account, but that can be used to reach you with promotional messages on other websites and applications. In addition, there are identifiers (that may or may not be associated with your account) that we use for managing an ad supported subscription plan. We will also collect information such as gender, if you join an ad supported subscription plan.\n\nCharacteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law: This covers a broad range of information like race, sex, marital status, among other protected classes. We will collect this sort of information about you if you choose to participate in our optional research surveys, or other research activity such as an in person interview or panel.

For example if you contact customer service, we may record the call (voice recording).\n\nInferences: We have a content recommendations system that strives to predict what you’ll be in the mood to watch when you log in.

We collect the following categories of CCPA personal information from consumers:\n\nIdentifiers: “Identifiers” covers a broad range of information, including things like name, email address, postal address, telephone number, and IP address. We collect some CCPA personal information that falls into this category. For example, for streaming subscribers we’re going to have an email address, payment information (like a credit card), and for DVD customers we’re going to have a postal address. We collect IP addresses, identifiers from the devices you might use to connect, and characteristics about the networks you use when you connect to our service online (see also “Information we collect automatically” above in the Privacy Statement). These sorts of identifiers are connected to your Netflix account. There are also identifiers we use for purposes like advertising (resettable device identifiers, third party advertising cookies on our website) that we do not associate with your account, but that can be used to reach you with promotional messages on other websites and applications. In addition, there are identifiers (that may or may not be associated with your account) that we use for managing an ad supported subscription plan. We will also collect information such as gender, if you join an ad supported subscription plan.\n\nCharacteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law: This covers a broad range of information like race, sex, marital status, among other protected classes. We will collect this sort of information about you if you choose to participate in our optional research surveys, or other research activity such as an in person interview or panel. We do not collect this information when you register for the Netflix service. This will include date of birth and gender if you join an ad supported subscription plan.\n\nCommercial information: This includes information about products or services considered, obtained or purchased.\n\nInternet or other electronic network activity information: We offer online services, so we collect CCPA personal information in this category, like your interactions with our service.\n\nGeolocation data: Our online services don’t collect precise geolocation data from GPS sensors. However, we do collect IP addresses from which we can determine your general location (such as your city, state/province, and postal code).\n\nAudio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory or similar information: We may collect photos, audio and/or video of you in certain circumstances. For example if you contact customer service, we may record the call (voice recording).\n\nInferences: We have a content recommendations system that strives to predict what you’ll be in the mood to watch when you log in. However, we do not have a list in our recommendations system that attaches socio-demographic information to you like “soccer dad who likes rom coms” or “financially savvy mom who craves action films” or “singleton high school grad who likes tiny houses.” We have a Help article that explains how our recommendations system works - spoilers: the biggest driver is what you actually choose to watch through our service.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
