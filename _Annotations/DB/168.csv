ra2,"We may need to collect and process Personal Data in order to provide requested information, products or services to you (including the Site) or because we are legally required to do so.\n\nMoody’s requests Personal Data from you if the Site requires registration. The registration process requests that you provide Personal Data, such as your name, business email address, business address or country/jurisdiction location, business phone number, and company affiliation, and agree to the User Agreement presented at the time of registration.\nMoody’s may receive Personal Data from social media platforms. For example, if you elect to use your social media credentials to log-in to your Site account, certain Personal Data from your social media account will be shared with us, which may include Personal Data that is part of your social media profile.  \nMoody’s may collect Personal Data voluntarily provided by you, including in emails, online forms, order and registration forms, surveys, promotion participation, online chats, phone calls, and through other means.\nMoody’s may request Personal Data from our customers to comply with applicable anti-money laundering laws and other applicable laws.\nOn some of Moody’s Sites you are able to maintain “portfolios,” where, if you are a registered user, you have the option to list financial instruments in which you have a special interest. To be useful, this information must be stored on the Site, and is accessible to anyone with whom you share your username and password. For this reason, please safeguard your username and password carefully and do not disclose them to any other person.\nWe may use third-party payment services (each, a “Payment Service”) to collect payments made through the Site.

Any Personal Data that you provide through a Payment Service page will be collected by the Payment Service and not by Moody’s, and will be subject to Payment Service’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. Moody’s has no control over, and is not responsible for, a Payment Service’s use of information collected through a Payment Service page.\nMoody’s collects information through various other means, including searches online, participation at conferences and events, individual introductions, from employers that enroll their employees in our services or provide services to us, and from selected third-party business partners. From time to time, we may also acquire from third parties certain lists containing the names and contact information of individuals who may be interested in our products and services.\nWe collect name and professional contacts details of employees of our service providers, either directly from those third-party employees or from their employers.\nOur commercial real estate information products and services contain limited Personal Data (name, address and telephone number) about commercial property owners, brokers, tenants, buyers and sellers, who may at times be individuals, not corporate entities. We source this Personal Data directly and indirectly (via information providers) from public records, including county-level tax data and Secretary of State LLC, publicly- available websites, and crowdsourcing (as can add data themselves).",Categories of Personal Information Collected
