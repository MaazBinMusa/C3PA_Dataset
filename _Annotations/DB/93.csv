We collect and process device identified data from users who consent to location data sharing via our partners apps for purposes related to advertising, attribution, analytics, research, and cross-device identity (“Location Data”).\n\nLocation Data is received either from an “SDK” (software development kit) that it provides to mobile application partners (“apps”) or from a server-to-server transfer and integration with mobile app partners. This location information includes data points such as lat/long (latitudinal and longitudinal) data, i.e., GPS-level data, and/or WiFi data (if feasible) associated with a mobile advertising ID, such as an IDFA on iOS platforms or a Google Play Advertising ID on Android platforms.\n\nPlatforms\n\nCuebiq operates a PaaS or platform-as-a-service (“Spectus PaaS” or “PaaS”) which provides our Customers an open, secure, and privacy controlled environment to analyze, create, optimize, and export data of all types and sources through a combination of data and tools provided to them (including, but not limited to  Location Data), tools and data they may develop or import on their own, or obtain from third parties via PaaS. Cuebiq acts as a data processor in operating PaaS, which means that Cuebiq acts only upon instructions from PaaS Customers. Each PaaS user that uploads data and makes it available to other PaaS customers is responsible for the content, compliance, and permissible uses of that data and must communicate any limitations to other PaaS customers.\n\nCuebiq also operates a SaaS or software-as-a-service (“Clara”) where we provide precomputed reports for Customers. Cuebiq acts as a data controller in operating Clara, which means that we direct the processing of Location Data to generate the reports for Customers.\n\nWe refer to all of the above services as the “Services.”",Categories of Personal Information Shared / Disclosed
