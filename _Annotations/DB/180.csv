ra6,"You may contact us at the methods set out in Section 11 above to exercise your rights as a California consumer. We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of our receipt. If we need to request additional information from you to verify your identity, we will use that information solely for purposes of verification. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to your email address linked to your account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by email in our record or an alternative way at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we have no obligation to respond to you if your Personal Information was collected for a single, one-time transaction, if such information is not sold or retained by HTM.\n\nWe do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. We have no obligation to provide you with responses more than two times in a 12-month period.\n\n",Methods to exercise rights
