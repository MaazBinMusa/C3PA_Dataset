ra3,"PIPEDA (Canada)\n\nRRD recognizes and has controls in place to ensure that the privacy of personal data about an ""identifiable individual"" used in the course of ""commercial activity"" is protected and managed in such a manner which meets or exceeds the guidelines set out in PIPEDA and applicable provincial legislation.\n\nGDPR and the Standard Contractual Clauses (European Union, Switzerland and United Kingdom)\n\nRRD uses Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and internal assessments to ensure that appropriate data safeguards can be used as a ground for data transfers from the EU, Switzerland, and UK to third countries. These clauses have been “pre-approved” by the European Commission under the GDPR for data transfers from controllers or processors in the EU/EEA (or otherwise subject to the GDPR) to controllers or processors established outside the EU/EEA (and not subject to the GDPR).\n\nRRD may obtain in the US the following types of EU, UK and Swiss information: name, address, invoice information including bank account information, and order information (“EU, UK and Swiss Business Contact Information”). RRD uses EU, UK and Swiss Business Contact Information for the following purposes: managing customer relationships, managing orders, tracking payments and ensuring payment, and otherwise maintaining the customer relationship. RRD may disclose EU, UK and Swiss Business Contact Information to its affiliates, subsidiaries, business partners, and service providers for the purposes listed above.\n\nIn situations where RRD discloses (i.e., onward transfers) EU, UK and Swiss Business Contact Information to any third parties acting as service providers or “agents"" on behalf of RRD, RRD will require the recipient to protect the disclosed EU, UK and Swiss Business Contact Information in accordance with the Standard Contractual Clauses, or otherwise take steps to ensure that the EU, UK and Swiss Business Contact Information is appropriately protected. With respect to any sharing of EU, UK and Swiss Business Contact Information for the purposes of marketing RRD products and services, RRD obtains guarantees from its affiliates, subsidiaries and business partners that such entities will use and disclose such EU, UK and Swiss Business Contact Information for purposes of marketing RRD products and services only. In cases of onward transfer of EU, UK or Swiss Business Information to third parties pursuant to Standard Contractual Clauses, RRD is potentially liable in the event of an improper disclosure. In certain situations, individuals may seek to opt-out of disclosures of their EU, UK and Swiss Business Contact Information by contacting RRD as specified in the “Contacting RRD” section below.\n\nRRD takes appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard EU, UK and Swiss personal data against unauthorized or unlawful processing of, or accidental loss, damage, misuse, unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized alteration, or destruction, and maintains reasonable procedures to help ensure that such information is relevant for its intended use, accurate, complete, current and not excessive and that such information is not retained longer than is reasonably necessary.\n\nWith respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Standard Contractual Clauses, RRD is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the United States Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, RRD may disclose EU, UK and Swiss personal data as necessary in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of its business, where required or permitted by law, where RRD believes that such disclosures are appropriate in connection with a law enforcement request or as otherwise permitted by the Standard Contractual Clauses, or in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud or in order to comply with, enforce or apply RRD agreements.\n\nWhile RRD has certified its adherence to and continues to comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield framework, RRD no longer relies on Privacy Shield as a legal basis for cross-border transfers of personal data from the EU to the US, and instead utilizes SCCs and internal assessments for such as described above.\n\nEuropean Union, UK and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy policy should contact the RRD Privacy point of contact - at DataPrivacy@rrd.com. RRD will respond to your inquiry within 45 days.\n\nIn the event of a reported complaint that RRD does not resolve itself, RRD commits to cooperate with the EU Data Protection Authorities (DPA’s) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) and comply with the advice given by the EU DPA panel or Swiss Commissioner with regard to human resource and non-human resource data transferred from the EU,UK and Switzerland to RRD in the United States (US).\n\nData Processor Activities\n\nRRD operates as a data processor for our business customers located in the US, EU, UK and other geographic locations worldwide. RRD's business customers remain the data controllers with respect to any Customer data that they provide to RRD for our provision of services. RRD therefore acts in accordance with the instructions of such customers regarding the collection, processing, storage, deletion and transfer of Customer data, as well as other matters such as the provision of access to and rectification of this Customer data.\n\nChildren's Online Privacy Protection - COPPA\n\nRRD does not sell its services to children. As such, our Sites are designed for adult user interaction. We do not intentionally collect personally identifiable data from children under the age of 13.\n\nAccessing and Updating Your Personal Data\n\nIf you have provided RRD with your personal data you have various rights:\n\nIf you are a data subject based in the EU (and to the extent that Article 3(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 applies to you) and where we control your data you have the right:\n\n(in certain circumstances) to erasure of personal data (and to therefore be forgotten);\n\nto data portability;\n\nto launch a complaint with the office of the Information Commissioner;\n\nto inspect the data stored by RRD for accuracy;\n\nto have the option to opt-out or opt-in for further communications from RRD\n\nvia Subject Access Request, to know whether or not we are processing your personal data, the nature of that personal data and the purposes of the processing.",Others
