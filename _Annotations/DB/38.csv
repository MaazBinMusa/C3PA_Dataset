A cookie contains a unique number, which is used to recognize your computer when a user of your computer or mobile device returns to a website that it has visited previously. The Sites also may contain small, transparent images, files, or lines of code that collect information about how you interact with the pages, emails, advertisements, and apps. For example, these technologies may collect information about the web pages you visit, the content you view, when and for how long you interact with certain features, and whether you respond to advertisements.\n\nWe may use these technologies to identify your computer or device (which can help us or our service providers recognize you when you return), store information about your preferences (e.g., preferred language), log your interactions (e.g., the types of messages you prefer to receive), and present you with more relevant interest-based advertisements. We retain this information in a form that can identify your computer or device for up to 180 days. We do not respond to Do Not Track signals.\n\nInformation from Other Sources\nWe also collect information from third-party sources, including business contact databases, data aggregators, and publicly-available sources and records.

Where required by applicable law, we rely on one of the following legal bases to justify our processing of your personal information:\n\nto fulfil our contractual obligations to you, for example to provide access to Sites that you request and to ensure that invoices are delivered or paid correctly. Failure to provide personal information necessary to perform a contract may prevent or delay the fulfilment of our contractual obligations;\nto comply with our legal obligations, for example to respond to legally binding requests from regulators, law enforcement authorities, or other government authorities;\nto meet our legitimate interests, for example to understand how you use the Sites and to enable us to derive knowledge that enables us to develop new Offerings.
