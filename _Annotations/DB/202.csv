In order to increase the relevance of online advertisements, our technology collects information about users as they visit websites that partner with us. Datonics typically collects this information when a User visits a website where our technology is used or enters a word or phrase into a search engine or conducts a search for a product or service where our technology is used. Datonics also collects data provided by select data partners, including demographic information (e.g., area code, city, gender, age), life stage data, and business-to-business data. This data may have been originally collected either online or offline. Datonics also collects information about users’ mobile devices, including the advertising identifiers assigned to their devices (on iOS devices, the IDFA, and on Android devices, the Advertising Identifier) from its data partners, and may associate those identifiers with data that it collects directly and other devices it has associated with you.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
