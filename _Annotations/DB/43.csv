ra3,"Information That We Collect and Use in Our Services\nIn order to provide our Services, we receive data, including personal information, from a variety of sources, including from websites and apps that collect the information, public sources, and other data compilers. We refer to the information that we collect and process throughout this Privacy Policy as “Information” or “the Information.”\n\nThe Information often includes various identifying and demographic information about individuals.. It often includes personal attributes such as name, address and other contact information. It may also include information (on the individual, household, or wider (e.g., zip code) level), such as:\n\nProfessional information, including occupation and job title,\nParticular interests, such as (for instance) home improvement, music, online shopping, health and beauty sport, or travel, or political leanings\nDemographic information, such as age, gender, level of education or likely income range.\nThis type of information may be inferred – for instance, if a household is in a particularly wealthy area, we might infer a particular income range.\n\nStirista also receives information through this website (and any other website we operate). We describe this information in Section 6.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
ra3,"How We Use the Information\nStirista uses the Information for various purposes, including the following.\n\nAs Part of Our Services:\n\nData Marketing Services. Our Services include providing marketing information to our customers, generally regarding which customers or prospective customers are most likely to be interested (or disinterested) in certain offers. Similarly, we help our customers identify and understand their customers better, by providing insights about them. Our customers include (but are not limited to) brands and agencies and various marketing data platforms that help them to market and advertise to their own customers (and prospective customers); our customers also include other data compilers, who work with their own customers.\nOnline Targeting. We sometimes create defined audience segments (“Audience Segments”) based on common demographics and/or shared (actual or inferred) interests or preferences (e.g., households with tech professionals, or with an interest in winter travel). When we do this, we may work with a data partner that “matches” our Information through de-identification techniques (such as through coded data “hashing”) with online cookies and other identifiers, in order to target and measure ad campaigns online across various display, mobile and other media channels. You may learn more about how to opt out of this and other online ad targeting in Section 4.\nAdditional Marketing Services. Other Services we may sometimes provide to our customers (or that they may provide to their own customers), which may overlap with or supplement the above, may involve (a) help with targeting and optimizing direct mail, email campaigns, display, social and mobile marketing; (b) measuring how effective marketing campaigns have been, by determining which messages are most likely to be seen or opened by which types of consumers, or which types of ads are most likely to lead to purchases; (c) analyzing and optimizing our customers’ (or their service providers’) proprietary databases, or helping customers to detect and prevent fraud; or (d) providing “validation” or data hygiene services, which is how companies update and/or correct their databases by verifying or removing or correcting old, incorrect or outdated information.\nTo Operate Our Services\nWe also use the Information for our own internal purposes – such as to improve, test, update and verify our own database; develop new products; operate, analyze, improve and secure our Services and our databases and servers.",Categories of Personal Information Collected

Stirista uses the Information for various purposes, including the following.

As Part of Our Services:

Data Marketing Services. Our Services include providing marketing information to our customers, generally regarding which customers or prospective customers are most likely to be interested (or disinterested) in certain offers. Similarly, we help our customers identify and understand their customers better, by providing insights about them. Our customers include (but are not limited to) brands and agencies and various marketing data platforms that help them to market and advertise to their own customers (and prospective customers); our customers also include other data compilers, who work with their own customers.
Online Targeting. We sometimes create defined audience segments (“Audience Segments”) based on common demographics and/or shared (actual or inferred) interests or preferences (e.g., households with tech professionals, or with an interest in winter travel). When we do this, we may work with a data partner that “matches” our Information through de-identification techniques (such as through coded data “hashing”) with online cookies and other identifiers, in order to target and measure ad campaigns online across various display, mobile and other media channels. You may learn more about how to opt out of this and other online ad targeting in Section 4.
Additional Marketing Services. Other Services we may sometimes provide to our customers (or that they may provide to their own customers), which may overlap with or supplement the above, may involve (a) help with targeting and optimizing direct mail, email campaigns, display, social and mobile marketing; (b) measuring how effective marketing campaigns have been, by determining which messages are most likely to be seen or opened by which types of consumers, or which types of ads are most likely to lead to purchases; (c) analyzing and optimizing our customers’ (or their service providers’) proprietary databases, or helping customers to detect and prevent fraud; or (d) providing “validation” or data hygiene services, which is how companies update and/or correct their databases by verifying or removing or correcting old, incorrect or outdated information.",Categories of Personal Information Collected

ra4,"3. OUR BUSINESS PURPOSES FOR COLLECTING AND SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION
Generally speaking, we collect and share the Personal Information that we collect for the following purposes, as we also have described in our Privacy Policy and/or our website.

Our Purposes for collecting, using and sharing Personal Information
Data marketing services, for example:
·      Generally, creating data marketing tools and products for our marketer clients, as more fully described in our Privacy Policy (and on our websites).   This includes our provision of datasets, data “appends” (connecting data across datasets), data “scoring” (providing inferences about potential consumer behavior), data hygiene services (helping customers to evaluate, validate and correct personal information they hold), and security and anti-fraud services (helping customers to identify potentially fraudulent activity).

·         Helping our Clients identify and understand their consumers better, by providing insights about them and managing loyalty programs, as well as providing financial and other scoring products.

·         Assisting our Clients through our Services to provide their current and prospective customers with better service, improved offerings, and special promotions, for instance, advising on which current or prospective customers are most likely to be interested (or disinterested) in certain offers.

 
Online targeting, for example:

·         Creating or helping to create defined audience segments based on common demographics and/or shared (actual or inferred) interests or preferences (e.g., households with prospective students). When we do this, we work with a data partner that “matches” our or other Information through de-identification techniques (such as through coded data “hashing”) with online cookies and other identifiers, in order to target and measure ad campaigns online across various display, mobile and other media channels.

·         Assisting Clients in creating “identity” graphs, to help locate users across various channels, such as based on common personal, device-based, or network-based identifiers (e.g., IP address, email address).

Additional marketing services, for example (which may overlap with “data marketing services” above):
·         Assisting in targeting and optimizing of direct mail and email campaigns, display, mobile and social media marketing.

·         Measuring the effectiveness of online or offline ad campaigns by determining which messages are most likely to be seen or opened by which types of consumers, or which types of ads are most likely to lead to purchases.

·         Analyzing and optimizing our Clients’ (or their service providers’) proprietary databases, or helping Clients to identify and mitigate potential fraud.

·         Providing “verification” or data “hygiene” services, which is how companies update and/or “clean” their databases by either verifying or removing or correcting old, incorrect or outdated information.

Operating our Services, for example: 
·         Improving, testing, updating and verifying our own database.

·         Developing new products.

·         Operating, analyzing, improving, and securing our Services.

Other internal purposes, for example:
For internal research, internal operations, auditing, detecting security incidents, debugging, short-term and transient use, quality control, and legal compliance.

We sometimes use the information collected from our own website,  from social networks, from other “business to business” interaction (such as at trade shows) or from data compilers for the above, as well as for our own marketing purposes.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
