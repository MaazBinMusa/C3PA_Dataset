From Your Internet-Connected Devices\nWhen Providers we work with integrate our technology with their devices, apps, sites or services, we collect the following types of data about you and your device through those partners.\n\nDevice Data. Device data includes details about the device(s) you use, such as its manufacturer; model; registered country code; mobile carrier; operating system and version; crash data (if applicable); and what settings and permissions you’ve enabled. Your device and software settings affect what information your device makes available to us such as the language you prefer to use on your mobile device; mobile applications you install on your device and purchase you make in those mobile applications; bluetooth or wireless preferences; and the like. We may collect this information from mobile devices, internet-connected televisions, desktop and laptop computers, and/or other internet-connected devices.\n\nIdentifiers.

We collect information about the specific apps & sites you may use and/or visit on your device(s), such as the names of those apps, sites, and other relevant metadata.\n\nGeolocation Data.

Note that some of our data may fall into more than one of the above categories. For example, an IP address is both a unique identifier and device data.\n\nB. From Third Parties and Aggregated Public Sources:\nWe may collect information from public and private sources of aggregated data (e.g. the Apple App Store and the Android Play Store), website crawling, or from other third parties or public sources that we use in providing the VentiveIQ Services:\n\nMetadata about mobile apps\n\nPoint of Interest data such as an identifier for a commercial location and relevant metadata(e.g. a retail store or a coffee shop)\n\nCensus data and other publicly available data sources\n\nOther sources of behavioral, purchase, demographic information, and/or identifiers\n\nC.
