ra5,"Notice to Residents of European and UK Countries: Data Subject Rights

If located in the European Union, Switzerland, Norway, Lichtenstein, Iceland, or the United Kingdom (the “European and UK Countries”), individuals have certain rights and protections under applicable law regarding the processing of Personal Information.f located in the European Union, Switzerland, Norway, Lichetenstein, Iceland, or the United Kingdom (the “European and UK Countries”), individuals have certain rights and protections under applicable law regarding the processing of Personal Information.

Role of Sovrn as a Controller or Processor
If located in one of the European and UK Countries, Sovrn may act as a “controller” as defined under applicable law when processing Personal Information. Sovrn may also act as a “processor” as defined under applicable law to the extent that we process Personal Information on behalf of and at the instruction of another party, for example a Sovrn client.

Legal Basis for Processing
Sovrn’s legal basis for processing Personal Information depends upon the specific context in which it is collected or used. We rely on data subject consent (as defined under applicable law) to process Personal Information for Interest-Based Advertising, which we require Publishers using Sovrn Services to obtain on our behalf. In some cases, we may rely on our legitimate interests to collect and use Personal Information, except where our interests are overridden by data-protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we will process Personal Information collected from Interest-Based Advertising in order to improve the Sovrn Services for our Publishers. Our legitimate interests are described in greater detail in the “How We Use Information” section of this Privacy Policy. These legitimate interests include the operation of our business and the provision of Sovrn Services to our Publishers as required by our agreements with them.

Additionally, we may have a legal obligation to process Personal Information (such as for fraud prevention).

Exercising Data Subject Rights
Individuals may be entitled to exercise certain data subject rights available under applicable laws. These rights may include the right to request access to Personal Information we hold. Individuals may also have the right to object to, or request that we restrict, processing of Personal Information, such as profiling we perform for the purposes of direct marketing and interest-based advertising. Individuals may also have the right to ask that your Personal Information be corrected, erased, or transferred to another party. Where we have asked for consent to process data, consent may be withdrawn.

Anyone afforded any of these rights may exercise them by visiting our Privacy Center, or by contacting privacy@sovrn[.]com.

These rights may be limited in some situations–for example, where we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process data. In some instances, this may mean that we are able to retain data even if consent is withdrawn. In other instances, we may provide the requested information with some portions redacted in order to adhere to obligations of confidentiality to others.

Where we require Personal Information to comply with legal or contractual obligations, provision of Personal Information is mandatory; in all other cases, provision of requested Personal Information is optional.

Data Transfers
Sovrn is a global company headquartered in Boulder, Colorado, with data centers located in the United States and Europe. By visiting Publisher’s sites who are using Sovrn Services, Personal Information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us, our affiliates, and by those third parties with whom we may share your information, some of which are located outside of the European and UK Countries.

These countries (including the United States) may have data protection or other laws that differ from those in European and UK Countries. We ensure that where Sovrn or third-party service providers receive Personal Information outside of the European and UK Countries, appropriate safeguards are in place under European and UK data protection legislation.

Sovrn may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.  Such requests are subject to Sovrn’s Law Enforcement Request Policy.

IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework
Sovrn is registered as a vendor with, and supports and encourages our clients to use, the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework (the “IAB Industry Framework”) to provide data subjects with dynamic transparency into and choice about the various vendors our clients use to serve ads, including Sovrn Services. When visiting a website, the IAB Industry Framework is designed to allow a Publisher the means to choose which registered vendors they wish to allow to access a device and process Personal Information, and provide dynamic transparency and choice about each of these vendors (either an opportunity for an individual to consent to the vendor, or opt out of data processing by the vendor, depending on that vendor’s legal basis and processing activities).

Questions or Complaints
Individuals located in one of the European and UK Countries who have questions or concerns about how we process Personal Information may contact our Data Protection Officer at dpo@sovrn[.]com. If we are not able to resolve the issue, individuals have the right to lodge a complaint with their local data privacy authority. For contact details of local Data Protection Authorities, please visit the European Data Protection Board member list.

If located in the European Union, Switzerland, Norway, Lichtenstein, Iceland, or the United Kingdom (the “European and UK Countries”), individuals have certain rights and protections under applicable law regarding the processing of Personal Information.f located in the European Union, Switzerland, Norway, Lichetenstein, Iceland, or the United Kingdom (the “European and UK Countries”), individuals have certain rights and protections under applicable law regarding the processing of Personal Information.

Role of Sovrn as a Controller or Processor
If located in one of the European and UK Countries, Sovrn may act as a “controller” as defined under applicable law when processing Personal Information. Sovrn may also act as a “processor” as defined under applicable law to the extent that we process Personal Information on behalf of and at the instruction of another party, for example a Sovrn client.

Legal Basis for Processing
Sovrn’s legal basis for processing Personal Information depends upon the specific context in which it is collected or used. We rely on data subject consent (as defined under applicable law) to process Personal Information for Interest-Based Advertising, which we require Publishers using Sovrn Services to obtain on our behalf. In some cases, we may rely on our legitimate interests to collect and use Personal Information, except where our interests are overridden by data-protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we will process Personal Information collected from Interest-Based Advertising in order to improve the Sovrn Services for our Publishers. Our legitimate interests are described in greater detail in the “How We Use Information” section of this Privacy Policy. These legitimate interests include the operation of our business and the provision of Sovrn Services to our Publishers as required by our agreements with them.

Additionally, we may have a legal obligation to process Personal Information (such as for fraud prevention).

Exercising Data Subject Rights
Individuals may be entitled to exercise certain data subject rights available under applicable laws. These rights may include the right to request access to Personal Information we hold. Individuals may also have the right to object to, or request that we restrict, processing of Personal Information, such as profiling we perform for the purposes of direct marketing and interest-based advertising. Individuals may also have the right to ask that your Personal Information be corrected, erased, or transferred to another party. Where we have asked for consent to process data, consent may be withdrawn.

Anyone afforded any of these rights may exercise them by visiting our Privacy Center, or by contacting privacy@sovrn[.]com.

These rights may be limited in some situations–for example, where we can demonstrate that we have a legal requirement to process data. In some instances, this may mean that we are able to retain data even if consent is withdrawn. In other instances, we may provide the requested information with some portions redacted in order to adhere to obligations of confidentiality to others.

Where we require Personal Information to comply with legal or contractual obligations, provision of Personal Information is mandatory; in all other cases, provision of requested Personal Information is optional.

Data Transfers
Sovrn is a global company headquartered in Boulder, Colorado, with data centers located in the United States and Europe. By visiting Publisher’s sites who are using Sovrn Services, Personal Information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us, our affiliates, and by those third parties with whom we may share your information, some of which are located outside of the European and UK Countries.

These countries (including the United States) may have data protection or other laws that differ from those in European and UK Countries. We ensure that where Sovrn or third-party service providers receive Personal Information outside of the European and UK Countries, appropriate safeguards are in place under European and UK data protection legislation.

Sovrn may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.  Such requests are subject to Sovrn’s Law Enforcement Request Policy.

IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework
Sovrn is registered as a vendor with, and supports and encourages our clients to use, the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework (the “IAB Industry Framework”) to provide data subjects with dynamic transparency into and choice about the various vendors our clients use to serve ads, including Sovrn Services. When visiting a website, the IAB Industry Framework is designed to allow a Publisher the means to choose which registered vendors they wish to allow to access a device and process Personal Information, and provide dynamic transparency and choice about each of these vendors (either an opportunity for an individual to consent to the vendor, or opt out of data processing by the vendor, depending on that vendor’s legal basis and processing activities).

Questions or Complaints
Individuals located in one of the European and UK Countries who have questions or concerns about how we process Personal Information may contact our Data Protection Officer at dpo@sovrn[.]com. If we are not able to resolve the issue, individuals have the right to lodge a complaint with their local data privacy authority. For contact details of local Data Protection Authorities, please visit the European Data Protection Board member list.
