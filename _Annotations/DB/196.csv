The right to erasure (also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’) – under certain circumstances, you may ask us to delete the personal data we have about you (unless it remains necessary for us to continue processing your personal data for a legitimate business need or to comply with a legal obligation as permitted under the GDPR, in which case we will inform you). Note that Business Profile Data may be deleted by clicking here;
The right to restrict processing – your right, under certain circumstances, to ask us to suspend our processing of your personal data;
The right to data portability – your right to ask us for a copy of your personal data in a common format (for example, a .csv file);
