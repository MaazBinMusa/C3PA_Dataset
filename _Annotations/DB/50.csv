ra3,"Privacy Policy Changes\nWe may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes with respect to our practices relating to your personal information, we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this website prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.",Updated Privacy Policy
ra3,"Data Collection & Use\nWe may collect various types of information from connected devices and web browsers using scripts, cookies, web beacons, software development kits (“SDK”), or other similar techniques. These technologies are used to collect digital actions of users that visit and use websites, applications, and connected devices or interact with ads presented on websites and devices of our platform members. We also receive other data (e.g., demographic information and digital identifiers) from third parties or through analytical techniques that we combine with the data we collect or derive through the Services.\n\nThe categories of data we collect or receive may include:\n\nDigital identifiers, such as device identifiers and IP addresses;\nInformation about the browser and operating system type and version, device type, and other data from or about a device;\nPurchase history and transactional data such as records of products or services purchased, obtained, or considered\nPrecise geolocation data;\nPostal addresses; and\nInformation about users’ web viewing, application usage, and device usage information including what advertisements are interacted with.\nWe may collect or receive this data from a variety of sources, including over time across different mobile apps, websites, browsers, or Internet-connected devices. We may also receive data related to the location of a device from our platform members and other parties, such as consumer data resellers. We may also receive physical address information from our customers or other third parties, or we may derive address information from other location information we receive or collect from devices.\n\nWe may use any of the data we collect and receive for a variety of business purposes including analytics; auditing; research; reporting; attribution; detecting security incidents and illegal, deceptive, or fraudulent activity; service enhancements and other business operations; predicting possible relationships among different browsers and devices; differentiating and/or associating multiple device users as well as associating devices or users with locations such as a household or workplace; frequency capping and other auditing purposes; and in multiple ways to make ads more relevant across various connected devices, browsers, through direct mail, and any other advertising channel, such as by inferring potential interests based on web viewing, application use, location, and device usage activity for advertising purposes.\n\nFor instance, we may use location data for proximity or audience advertising. Proximity advertising uses location and other data to present ads based on a device’s current location. Another example would be using location and other data to create “audiences” – groups of Internet-connected devices that are inferred to share similar interests or other characteristics based on the information we collect – to deliver ads that we believe may be more relevant to those audiences through various advertising channels. We consider both proximity and audience advertising to be interest-based advertising as described in this policy. We retain data used for interest-based advertising only as long as we have a legitimate business purpose to retain such data, or as otherwise required by applicable law.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
ra3,"Data Sharing\nWe may share the various types of information we collect and infer about devices and users with our affiliates, third party partners and agents for advertisement targeting, audience extension across different browsers, devices and various other advertising channels, to make and create offers, for other marketing and advertising purposes, to provide reporting to advertisers and clients, to improve our systems and products, and for other research and analytical purposes.\n\nWe may also share data with contractors and service providers who work on our behalf. We may disclose data in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights and obligations or defend against legal claims. We may also transfer data in the event of an acquisition or merger with another company, including at bankruptcy.",Categories of Personal Information Shared / Disclosed
