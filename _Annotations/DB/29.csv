When you contact us (for example via email, phone or online web forms), we will collect Personal Information provided by you, such as your first and last name, telephone number, email address, physical address, employer name, as well as any other content that you provide (“General Communication Information”). If you do not provide certain General Communication Information, we may not be able to answer your requests or queries.\nAccount Information. We may collect usernames, passwords, and other details of account-level information from representatives of business Customers when they correspond with us by phone or email, or request support for the Services (“Account Information”). If they do not provide certain Account Information, such as usernames and passwords, they may not be able to use the Services or take advantage of certain features of the Services.\nBilling Information. We may collect billing information from representatives of our business Customers when they purchase our Services, such as billing name and address, ACH, or credit card number.\nPersonal Information Provided by Customers\nCustomer Data. We collect information in the form of queries submitted to the Services by business Customers for identity verification and fraud prevention and detection purposes. Such queries may contain the name, e-mail address, physical address, phone number, and IP address of the business Customer’s consumers (“Customer Data”). When a Customer submits Customer Data to the Services, Ekata may analyze Customer Data in conjunction with Ekata Data (see below) and other Customers’ data, to create Metadata (see below) to provide results to the Customer’s query.\nPersonal Information Derived from Customer Data\nMetadata. We derive information from our analysis of Customer Data, such as the number of times a data element has been queried in a period of time (velocity) or the last time a data element has been seen (recency), and hashed, encrypted Customer Data (“Metadata”). On this basis we identify behavioral patterns that give us insights for our fraud prevention and identity verification services (e.g., patterns confirming that your address is current and genuine).\nThird parties\nThird party data. We obtain Personal Information from publicly available sources and from third party data providers, who may collect the information from publicly available sources or directly from individuals, to enable us to provide our Services. This data collection includes the mapping of IP addresses to non-precise location data (e.g., city, state), and the collection of the following data elements: name, e-mail address, physical address, phone number, and IP address. Ekata includes such third party data together with Metadata (collectively “Ekata Data”) in its own database.\nPersonal Information Automatically Obtained from Your Interaction with the Services\nUsage Information (such as cookies and similar technologies). When you visit our website or use our Pro Insight service, we may collect certain information by automated means such as cookies, web beacons, and embedded scripts. This Usage Information may include standard information from a web browser (such as browser type and browser language), an IP address, device identifier numbers, and the actions a website visitor or Customer takes on Pro Insight (such as how a visitor/Customer interacts with the web pages and the links clicked). For detailed information about the use of cookies and similar technologies, please see our below short summary and our Cookie Consent Tool.\nCookies: Our Web pages and Pro Insight use “cookies” and similar technologies. A cookie is a file stored on your device that may be used to identify an individual as a unique user by storing certain personal preferences and user data. We use cookies and other technologies to identify your device, identify authorized users of Pro Insight, and track affiliate referrals.\nWeb Beacons: We may also use web beacons, small graphic images, or other web programming code which may be included in our Web pages and e-mail messages. We may use Web beacons (or similar technologies) to count visitors to Pro Insight, and to monitor how users navigate Pro Insight, among other legitimate business purposes.\nLog files, IP addresses, URLs, embedded scripts, and similar data: We gather certain information automatically to administer the Services and analyze trends in the aggregate. This information may include IP addresses (or the proxy server a business Customer uses to access the Services), device and application identifiers, browser type, Internet service provider, the pages and files viewed, searches conducted, operating system and system configuration information, and date/time stamps associated with usage. Also, Ekata automatically receives the URL of the Web site from which a business Customer came (if a business Customer follows a link to the Pro Insight). This information is used to analyze overall trends, and to provide and improve the Services. For example, Ekata collects IP addresses from Customers when they log into the Services as part of security features to confirm identity or detect compromised accounts. Ekata may also use embedded scripts, which are programming code designed to collect information about an interaction with a Web site, such as the links clicked on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto a device from our Web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Web site containing the embedded script, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
