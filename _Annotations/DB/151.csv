In some states, such as California, these are legal rights for residents of the state.

ra6,"We try to help our clients tailor their advertising to the consumers most likely interested in their product, service or cause and to help our clients analyze and improve their marketing. To do this, we match our clients’ customer information to a specific consumer by comparing name and postal address or other offline identifiers or email address or other online identifiers. We are then able to associate a consumer or a de-identified consumer profile with other data, including demographic data, social media informed data, geographic data, transaction data and transaction-based insights, and other interest-based data. We analyze the data we have about consumers, such as purchase, subscription or donation information, demographic information, social media interests and other consumer information, using statistical models designed to predict consumer interest in specific offers from particular businesses and non-profit causes or in categories of product, service or cause. Our models predict not only who might be interested in our clients’ offers but which consumers are likely to have little or no interest in them. This can help improve our clients’ marketing decisions, which helps reduce the amount of irrelevant advertising consumers see and saves our clients money.

Once we complete our analysis, we provide our clients with the results in a format designed for the way they intend to use it. For example, when clients use our products to send direct mail or to better understand likely interests of their existing customers or donors, we typically provide our clients information associated with names and postal addresses or other individually identifying information. When our clients ask for help to connect with potentially interested consumers through digital channels, such as online or mobile advertising, we would typically provide our products in de-identified form using industry standard privacy practices. In these cases, we, or our client, or partner will combine the results of our analyses with digital identifiers in the applicable digital channel (such as with cookie IDs or other identifiers for web advertising, device IDs for mobile advertising or email addresses for email advertising). When our clients want information or recommendations about how to improve the effectiveness of their marketing, we may use our analysis to create aggregated reports about their customers or donors or about groups of consumers and their interests relative to the client’s product, service or cause.",Others

In all cases, our predictions are designed to identify those with likely interest in a product or service, and not a specific medical condition. In other words, we predict whether a person may be interested in buying these types of products (for themselves or others), but we do it without individual health information and do not predict that a person has a particular health condition on behalf of our clients or partners. In these cases, our predictive technology would seek to identify interest in the product, which might include consumers with a particular health condition and also consumers without the health condition. For example, for retailers selling maternity apparel, our predictive models seek to predict interest in that type of apparel, which will likely include those who are expectant parents (which we would not know), but also those who are not expectant parents (which we also would not know) but are likely to buy for other reasons, for example as a gift for others. In every case we strive to identify and follow industry best practices around consumer privacy and ethical use of data when making these predictions.

As improved tools are developed to be more comprehensive, we will evaluate them and expect the industry groups to which we belong will implement updated standards and tools.\n\nIt is important to recognize what these marketing opt-out options will not do. They do not preclude a particular company or organization that you have dealt with in the past from sending you their marketing offers, including those that are combined or associated with a digital identifier you use. This works well for most people, because they have a voluntary, mutually-beneficial relationship with those companies that they have dealt with previously. Those who prefer not to receive offers from a particular company need to contact the company directly and ask that they not receive any future marketing materials from them. Opting-out also will not prevent your information from being used for analyses we do internally where individual consumer information is not provided to our clients, such as when we produce aggregated marketing reports for our clients. If you wish for your information not to be used for aggregated reports, please request that we delete your information (please see “Deletion Requests,” below).\n\nDuring calendar year 2022, we received a total of 2,794 requests to opt-out, of which we complied with 2,423 in whole or in part and denied 371 due to failure of the requester to sufficiently authenticate the requester’s or the individual’s identity.
