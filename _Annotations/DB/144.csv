Dstillery provides this privacy policy to inform you how its proprietary technology processes information on behalf of the digital advertisers, website owners, and other businesses that use its services. This policy also outlines Dstillery’s privacy practices on its corporate website, www.Dstillery.com as well as the types of information we collect from our clients.\n\nIf you have any questions about this privacy policy, please feel free to email the company at privacy@Dstillery.com.",Updated Privacy Policy
ra6,"Dstillery thinks about the data we process in terms of whether or not the data may be used by Dstillery to identify a data subject. Accordingly, we place the data we process into two categories: identifiable personal data and pseudonymous personal data. We recognize that identifiable personal data and pseudonymous personal data are considered personal data under the applicable privacy or data protection laws in many places. However, we believe that data that may not be used to identify an individual is inherently less risky. Accordingly, Dstillery endeavors to use pseudonymous personal data via our Technology in most places and we use data minimization and de-identification techniques in places like the European Union and United Kingdom.\n\nIdentifiable personal data such as a name, a postal address, a telephone number or an email address is personally identifiable information (“PII”) in that can be used to identify or locate a particular person or entity.\n\nPseudonymous personal data such as a mobile ad ID, a cookie ID or an IP address is not personally identifiable (“Non-PII”) in that it cannot be used by Dstillery to identify or locate a particular person or entity.\n\nWe believe that distinguishing the data processed on the basis of whether it is identifiable is an important privacy distinction.",Categories of Personal Information Collected

Rather, Dstillery believes that if you’re interested in a particular product or service, your network neighbors are likely to also be interested in that product or service.
