Fifty Intelligence is a specialist in insights and analytics derived from the collection and processing of data from the Twitter platform, as well as other online platforms.

ra5,"Normally email addresses are provided to and processed by us in hashed or encrypted form, so they are unusable for sending emails, but still help us recognise similar users in order to generate insights.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
ra5,"These insights help clients understand their segments, analyse trends, shed light on new products, services, emerging categories, etc. Thanks to this intelligence, clients then have a better understanding of their users and customers’ needs and respond through market improvements of their products and services, and more relevant advertising.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
ra5,"4.2. Fifty Media: end-user data
Fifty Technology insights are used by Fifty Media to build out custom cookie-based segments and run digital advertising campaigns. Segments and data products are used by our teams and clients to run targeted social and programmatic advertising. Thanks to URL white lists and our targeting cookies placed on users’ computers, we are in a position to build audiences that we will serve ads to.

This is how we always enhance the relevance of the advertising we serve.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
ra5,"Although the legal basis that Fifty Media and Fifty Technology rely upon for targeted advertising is consent, we have also determined that we have a legitimate interest to collect and process personal data for the following purposes which have minimal effects on your privacy:

Frequency measurement / capping (counting the number of times ads have been seen): this is necessary if we want to make sure ads are not shown more than a certain number of times to the same user
 Viewability measurement (understanding if ads are seen by users, often related to their placement on a publisher page); this is needed to optimise advertising investment and therefore protect publisher revenue which the publisher needs to produce the content seen by the user
Click count (counting the number of times ads seen have been clicked on); this is necessary to understand which creative formats generate interest and engagement and which ones don’t
Understanding browsing behaviours of aggregated users
Testing ads
Conversion tracking (counting the number of times users who have seen ads have proceeded to buy a product or service); this is necessary to understand the overall return on investment of that ad and therefore whether the investment on that campaign is worthwhile and whether publishers will receive more or less investment",Categories of Personal Information Collected

We do not process any data which could be used, with the help of a third party, to determine the real-life identity of users. ",Categories of Personal Information Collected

Under the GDPR, personal sensitive data (also known as “special categories of data”) is any personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious and philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation.

Fifty Technology does not collect any personal sensitive data, except when it has manifestly been made public by the data subject (e.g. in their social media bios, photos or posts), as per article 9(2)(e) of the GDPR.",Categories of Personal Information Collected

The GDPR lists the following rights:
The right to be informed
The right of access
The right of rectification
The right to erasure
The right to restrict processing
The right to data portability
The right to object to certain processing
The right not to be subject to automated decision-making",Description of Right to Know PI Collected
ra5,"On the right to erasure, the main means of fulfilling that right is for us to delete personal data so that the data is permanently anonymised and cannot be de-anonymised, i.e. cannot be re-identified.

As we do not know your names, full email addresses, addresses, postcodes, we don’t know who you are, where you live, what you do, it might be hard to identify your personal data, or we might not be in a position where we can technically locate it. As we apply techniques such as data minimization (not processing more data than what is needed), we consider it would be against the spirit of the law to hold data allowing us to identify you in case you want to exercise your right to erasure",Description of Right to Delete
