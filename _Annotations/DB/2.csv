Blackbaud does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13 in the United States unless and until a student’s school has obtained appropriate parental consent for a student under the age of 13 to use BBID.

We collect, use, process and retain personal information of students solely to provide the educational services on behalf of the school and for the purposes set forth in our agreement with the school.
