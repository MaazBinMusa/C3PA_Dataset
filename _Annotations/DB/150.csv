Resonate performs research, often in conjunction with research partners, who assist us in engaging consumers and collecting information about the attitudes and values, brand preferences, preferred product attributes, demographics, and many other characteristics describing those individuals (“Research Members”), as well as the websites those Research Members visit online.  This research includes consumer surveys, to which we may associate online and digital identifiers as well as the reported survey responses that may regard Internet activity, purchasing behavior, and interests in certain products or topics.  For example, we may have an interest in understanding the views of the online population generally regarding the values that affect their purchasing of different products, or their stance on particular issues, such as climate change or healthcare reform and what a segment of this online population reads online. We may also work with partners to collect data from browsers or devices to help predict possible relationships among different browsers and devices to help us provide more relevant advertising across such devices and browsers.\nTo assist us in this research and to better target advertisements, Resonate may receive a variety of information through partnerships with online and offline third-party data providers, such as retailers, analytics companies, consumer data providers, advertisers, through our technology on non-affiliated websites and mobile apps, and other third parties.
