DATA SHARING\nAs to the personal information that we collect in the course of operating our Services, we may share and disclose such information as follows: \n\nWith our Customers and with our Providers: We provide TrueData Services to our Customers and Providers that include agencies; brands; mobile app publishers; third party marketing companies; advertising technology companies; marketing technology companies; digital advertisers; and other companies and not for profit organizations that use data for Advertising Services such as targeting; audience creation; measurement; analytics; and other purposes associated with advertising via online or mobile channels including display, mobile, social, email, and video; as well as for purposes conducting research and analysis of consumer behavior.  In some cases, the audiences we create for our Customers and Providers relate to health or the human body. You can review those segments, including a representative sample of the custom segments we create, on this page.\nWith our Service Providers: Service providers are companies that provide TrueData with business, technical, and operational services; and are different from Providers of data. We may also share your personal information with service providers and/or data processors to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. For example, we use service providers for business operations such as Site and data hosting. We may also use service providers to assist us with providing our TrueData Services to Customers or Providers (for instance, through the service provider’s own platform), or to assist us in marketing to our finding new customers.  \nWith your consent.  We may share information about you with third parties at your direction or with your consent.\nIn Connection with a Financing or Sale of Our Business: If a third party invests in, or acquires, some, or all, of our business or assets, we may disclose your information in connection with the sale (including during due diligence in preparation for the transaction).\nIn Connection with Legal Obligations: We may disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings, or similar legal process when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights; protect your safety or the safety of others; investigate fraud; or respond to a government request. In certain situations, TrueData may also be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities.\nWe may share and disclose the information we collect in our corporate capacity in most of the above ways as well:  we may share them with our service providers, with consent, in connection with financing or sale, or to exercise our legal obligations. ",Categories of Personal Information Shared / Disclosed

HOW TO CONTROL DATA COLLECTED ABOUT YOU\n\nWe recognize that your privacy is important to you, so we offer the following ways to give you control over the data that we collect from you.\n\nOpting out of Tailored Advertising:\n\nWe recognize that your privacy is important to you, so we offer the following ways to give you control over the data that we collect from you.\n\nOpting out of Tailored Advertising:\n\nWe use and share information we collect from both online and offline sources to inform the advertising you see online and to tailor it to your interests.  This may include using information collected across the online applications you use (such as on mobile devices, web browsers, or internet-connected televisions), or information associated with hashed email addresses or other hashed identifiers.\n\nThe Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) maintains a site with tools and instructions for how to opt out of Tailored Advertising by NAI member companies.  TrueData is a member of the NAI and adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct. To opt out of Tailored Advertising by TrueData and other NAI member companies, please visit:\n\nhttps://optout.networkadvertising.org\n\nIf you are interested in CTV opt-out, please use the following link to visit NAI’s CTV opt-out page:\n\nhttps://www.networkadvertising.org/internet-connected-tv-choices/ \n\nFurther, we also support our own TrueData Opt-Out process. If you use multiple devices or multiple email addresses, make sure you apply the opt out or data control mechanisms provided to all of the web browsers, internet-connected devices, and email addresses you use for a complete opt-out. Opting out using a single browser, device, or email address will not automatically opt out all browsers, devices, or email addresses you use.\n\nOther companies’ opt outs or data control mechanisms may function differently than ours. Note that when you opt out of Tailored Advertising, you may continue to receive contextual ads which are ads based on the content of the web page or app on which they appear.",Methods to exercise rights

ra2,"C. How to Exercise your Access and Deletion Rights\n\nThere are two ways to submit a request to access or delete your personal information. First, you may submit a request at ACCESS OR DELETE MY DATA PAGE. Second, you can submit your request via our toll-free number: (888) 868-5427. We are unable to process faxed requests at the toll-free number provided; if you would like to submit your request to us using our toll-free number,  please use a telephone to submit your request verbally. After the tone please very slowly state your email address and please also leave your telephone number as well, and we will contact you with the instructions on how to proceed with your request. When you finish recording you may hang up or press the pound key for more options. \n\nTo protect the privacy and security of your personal information, we will attempt to verify your identity before acting on your request.  Your request must include details sufficient for us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to the request.  To verify your request to know or delete, we may need to request additional information from you, and, in certain circumstances, we may ask you to verify your identity and proof of California residency, which may include a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the individual whose personal information is the subject of the request.  \n\nPlease also note that as part of the verification process, we’re required to consider (a) the difficulty of verifying whether data that we hold and data we have linked to it truly and solely belongs to the data subject making the request, along with (b) the potential adverse effects on disclosure of personal data to the wrong individual (or a person who is purposefully seeking the information of another).  Because such improper disclosure would likely adversely affect the privacy rights and freedoms of the relevant data subject/consumer, we limit certain personal data we make available.  In particular, we believe that in most cases we cannot verify to a sufficiently high degree that precise location data we have collected pertains to the person who has submitted the request, or whether either the person in possession of a device or the person requesting the information is the actual device owner.  (For instance, some people may be temporarily in possession of another person’s phone – e.g., a partner, friend or work colleague – whether consensually or not, and many phones are not password-protected).",Methods to exercise rights

ra2,"12. THE GDPR AND SIMILAR LAWS:  YOUR DATA CHOICES AND ACCESS RIGHTS\nIf you are a resident of one of many European countries, including the United Kingdom, an important European privacy law (or an equivalent counterpart to it) the General Data Privacy Regulation (the “GDPR”) provides you with certain rights, and places certain obligations on companies regarding how your “personal data” (as the GDPR uses that term) is used.  We describe those rights and obligations below, and how and in what circumstances we honor them.  \n\nYou may have similar rights in countries that have adopted statutes similar to the GDPR, such as Brazil and Turkey.\n\nWe set out our compliance with the GDPR and, to the extent applicable, those other laws, in this section.\n\nLegal Basis. The GDPR requires us to tell you about the legal ground we’re relying on to process any “personal data” (as the GDPR uses that term) about you. The legal grounds for us processing your personal data for the purposes set out in Section 2 above will typically be because:\n\nYou provided your (legally sufficient) consent;\nIt is necessary for our contractual relationship, e.g., in order to provide you services or features you’ve requested and we’ve promised;\nThe processing is necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations – for instance, to communicate with you about or to help honor your legal rights; and/or\nThe processing is in our legitimate interest.   For instance, we may process and share business data collected from our website or our events for our own internal marketing purposes, or other information for purposes of security, data hygiene or validation, in a manner that constitutes a “legitimate interest”.\nYour rights to deletion or revocation of consent (sometimes referred to as a right to be forgotten, to restrict processing, or to otherwise object to processing).  You have the right to request that we delete your personal data (or where applicable, withdraw your prior consent to our processing your data).  You may also request that we correct or “rectify,” restrict or delete your personal data.   You may exercise these rights by contacting us at privacy+international@truedata.co or through our website privacy portal located at  https://info-prod.truedata.co/access-delete-request .  If you request that we delete your personal data, or withdraw your consent, we will customarily retain a copy of your data sufficient to suppress it from our active databases in the future:  but if that is not what you wish, you may indicate that to us (in which case your information may be added to our database later, because we will not have “suppressed” it).\n\nMoreover, when we delete your personal data, we may retain it (to the extent legal permissible) for certain important (but narrow) internal purposes such as legal, compliance, accounting or auditing purposes, and in some cases, for security purposes.  \n\nPersonalized Online Advertising Opt-Outs.  You may object to profiling by online advertising platforms with whom we sometimes partner to help generate (and measure or analyze) “personalized” online advertising.  These platforms are generally separate third party “controllers” of your data.  You may visit industry websites provided at [https://optout.aboutads.info) (by the Digital Advertising Alliance) and https://optout.networkadvertising.org/ (by the Network Advertising Alliance) or https://www.Youronlinechoices.eu/ (the European Digital Advertising Alliance) to do so, as to many of the largest platforms involved in personalized online advertising.\n\nYou may unsubscribe from marketing and other communications that we may send (on behalf of ourselves or others) by clicking the “opt-out” or “unsubscribe” link in the footer of those emails. \n\nYour right to access your personal data.  In some jurisdictions, you may have the right to request access to a copy of your personal data.  You may request access to the personal data we hold about by visiting the web page at https://info-prod.truedata.co/access-delete-request.  when you request access to your information, we are required — for privacy and other important compliance reasons — to verify your identity in a legally sufficient manner: if we cannot do so, we will not be able to satisfy your access request.\n\nPlease note that as part of the verification process, we may not be able to sufficiently “verify” your identity in a manner sufficient to safeguard against the potential adverse privacy effects on disclosure of personal data to the wrong individual (or a person who is purposefully seeking the information of another).  Because such improper disclosure would likely adversely affect the privacy rights and freedoms of a relevant data subject/consumer, we limit certain personal data we make available.  In particular, we believe that in most cases we cannot verify to a sufficiently high degree that precise location data we have collected pertains to the person who has submitted the request, or whether either the person in possession of a device or the person requesting the information is the actual device owner.  (For instance, some people may be temporarily in possession of another person’s phone – e.g., a partner, friend or work colleague – whether consensually or not, and many phones are not password-protected.)  Where that is the case, we may provide a subset of the data that we hold.\n\nQuestions or Concerns.  If you have a complaint or concern or question about how we handle your personal data, please contact us as at the above contact addresses, and we will seek to address any concerns you may have.  If you are not happy with how we have attempted to resolve your complaint, you may contact the relevant data protection authority.\n\nWhen We are a Processor.  EU data protection law (and certain other data protection laws) makes a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “data controllers”) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “data processors”).   TrueData sometimes acts as a data controller (for instance, when we make decisions about the data that comprises our own datasets) and sometimes acts as a processor (for instance, if we ingest information that belongs to a customer, such as to analyze it solely for their benefit and at their direction).   We generally are only able to help data subjects exercise their rights as to data we are a data controller of.   If you have a question or request as to data we’re a processor of, you should generally address that to the relevant data controller.",Others
