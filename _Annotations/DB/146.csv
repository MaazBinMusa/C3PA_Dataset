For instance, we share the Information with tech and customer support providers, marketing and advertising providers, other data providers (such as to enhance or verify our Information), security and data hygiene vendors, payment vendors (as to our business to business information), and other companies that may help us deliver or develop Services.\nWe may share the Information to communicate with you and market to you, including through email, direct mail or display media (which in turn may rely on cookies and similar technologies, described elsewhere in this Privacy Notice, including in Section 6).\nWe will disclose your information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or to protect the rights, safety or property of ourselves or any person or entity. We may also cooperate with law enforcement agencies in any official investigation and we may disclose any Information to the requesting agency in doing so.\nIf we or all or substantially all of our assets, are purchased by another company (such as in a merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of stock and/or assets, or other corporate change or financing transaction), the Information in our possession will likely be transferred to the successor entity. We also may share the Information during the course of any due diligence process leading up to any such transaction.\nOur website(s) use cookies and similar technologies, both for its internal and operational purposes and to market to you (such as to retarget ads to you when you visit other sites across the Internet).\n\nLinks\nThis website may provide links to other websites that Webbula thinks users will find interesting or useful.  For instance, if we present information about a webinar by another company. Webbula is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites or companies.

Security and Data Integrity
Webbula uses various electronic, physical, technical, and procedural safeguards to protect and limit access to the information you provided to us via this online service. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure; you therefore should not rely on our (or any) security protocols to be foolproof. Additionally, please note that information you send to us electronically may not be secure when it is transmitted to us because we do not control the security of your delivery channel.
\nChildren’s Privacy
Our online services are not intended for children, and Webbula provides no products or service geared towards children. Our website at www.webbula.com does not knowingly solicit or collect personal information online from children under age 18.

Changes to this Privacy Policy
From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy.  Any changes to it will become effective when it is posted to our website.  Please check back to learn of any changes to this Privacy Policy.
\nStorage of Information in the United States
If you are accessing our website from outside of the United States, your connection likely will be through and to servers located in the United States and all Information you provide will likely be processed and securely maintained in our web servers and internal systems located within the United States.  (We generally store the Information used in our Services in the United States.)   Thus, you should be aware that in accessing this website or otherwise communicating with us, the Information we collect or receive from you may be subject to laws with lesser or different privacy standards than those in your own country (such as if you are in a country located in the European Union).

Your Privacy Rights
Depending on where you live, you may have certain rights with respect to your information.  For example, under several state laws (as they become effective), you may be able to ask us to:

provide access to certain information we hold about you, in some cases in a portable format, if technically feasible
update or correct your information
delete certain information
restrict the use of your information
We will respond within the time period prescribed by applicable law. Please note that many of the above rights are subject to exceptions and limitations.

Do Not Sell:  First, consumers may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information.  (This is required in some states, but we endeavor to extend this right to all consumers.)   Those laws may broadly defines “sale” in a way that may include allowing third parties, such as advertisers, advertising networks, to receive certain information such as cookies, IP address, device identifiers or other hashed identifiers, interests, browsing behavior and/or other activity to add to a profile about your device, browser, or you.
\nDepending on the consumer (and depending on whether the consumer is a Client of ours or a member of the public with whom we lack a direct relationship), we may disclose the following categories of information for such purposes which may be considered a sale (as defined by applicable law):

identification and demographics;
inference data, such as whether you may be likely to purchase certain goods in the near future.
To opt out of this type of sale, please go to https://webbula.com/opt-out-request/ and follow the instructions on that web page.

Do Not Share/Do Not Target:  Consumers also may opt out “targeted” advertising, which is also sometimes referred to as “interest based” or “personalized” advertising.  We refer to it here as “targeted” advertising.  (It is also referred to as “cross-context” advertising under California law.) (This “opt out” right is required in some states, but again, we endeavor to extend this right to all consumers.)

We do not directly control the sending or initiation of targeted advertising, which is generally performed with cookies and similar technologies.  However, we do sometimes provide personal information that is used in association with cookies and similar technologies for cross-context advertising.

In turn, to opt out of this type of targeting, you may request that we not “sell” your Information (see above instructions).   When you do so we will cease providing your Information for purposes of cross-context advertising.  You may also visit industry websites such as those operated by the National Advertising Initiative (NAI) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), which provide cookie-based opt-outs in respect to cross-context advertising.  (These opt-out solutions are generally cookie-based and specific to a particular browser, so if you switch browsers, or clear your cookies, you will generally need to refresh your opt-out.).  Finally, to the extent you have enabled a global opt-out preference signal, the providers we work with may recognize that signal to the extent required under applicable state laws.

In addition, to the extent you have enabled a global opt-out preference signal, we will recognize that signal to the extent required under applicable state laws.
\nFinally, although we do not obtain mobile device information, we work with business partners who may associate the personal information we provide to them with mobile ad identifiers.  You may opt-out of cross-context advertising or targeting performed by these companies through the mobile device settings for Android and Apple iOS devices. To exercise this type of opt-out, please visit the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and select “limit ad tracking” (Apple iOS) or “opt-out of interest-based ads” (Android). Also, you may visit  https://youradchoices.com/appchoices to download the AppChoices Tool to control interest-based advertising on apps on your mobile device and https://thenai.org/opt-out/mobile-opt-out/ for more information and instructions on opting out on mobile devices.

Accessing the Personal Information We Have About You
\nIn certain states you may have a right to “access” or “know” about the specific information we hold about you, such as to deliver our Services.   If you would like to request access of your personal information, you may do so by contacting us at 888-993-2285 ext 4 or you may visit our “Data Access Request” page at https://webbula.com/ca-eu-data-request/.

For security purposes (and as required under California law), we will verify your identity – in part by requesting certain information from you — when you request to exercise your California privacy rights.  For instance, if you request categories or specific pieces of personal information we have received about you, you may need to confirm your possession of an identifier (such as an email address) or to provide a piece of identification that confirms you are the person you claim to be.

Authorized Agents
\nIf you or (in certain states where required by law) your authorized agent would like to opt out of Webbula’s use of your information for such purposes (to the extent this is considered a sale, share, or targeted advertising), you may do so as outlined on the following page: https://webbula.com/opt-out-request/

Sensitive Data

Some states, like Colorado, Connecticut, and Virginia, provide their residents (upon the applicable effective dates), the right to opt-in to the processing of their sensitive personal information or personal data. To the extent you believe you may have opted in to the collection of such personal information/data, you can opt out at any time so by providing your email here https://webbula.com/opt-out-request/
Some states, like California and Utah, provide their residents (upon the applicable effective dates), have the right to opt-out of certain uses of their sensitive personal data. You can do so by providing your email here https://webbula.com/opt-out-request/
In some cases, you may appeal a decision made relating to your rights. Please contact us at privacy@webbula.com if you would like to inquire about an appeal.

Nevada Residents

Certain Nevada consumers may opt out of the sale of “covered information” for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell such information. “Covered information” includes first and last name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online.  Please contact us at privacy@webbula.com if you would like to opt out.

 
\nEU-US PRIVACY SHIELD
Privacy Shield Certification. As a business subject to the enforcement and investigatory powers of the Federal Trade Commission, Webbula, Inc. has certified our compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework with respect to the personal client data we receive from the relevant European countries, and the United Kingdom, effective as of the date our certification is posted at https://www.privacyshield.gov/list. You can learn more about the Privacy Shield program at https://www.privacyshield.gov. We may alternatively process personal data our clients in the EU submit via other compliance mechanisms, including data processing agreements based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses. (As to any third-party service providers we may use to process information subject to the Privacy Shield, we may have liability under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.)

Accessing Your Data: European and UK residents may have certain legal rights to access certain personal data and to obtain its correction, amendment, or deletion. You may contact us at the contact information below to request access, correction, amendment, or deletion. Because our personnel have limited rights to identify and access an individual user’s personal data that our client has submitted to us, and because we process that data on behalf of our clients, we may first refer you to the client who submitted your data, and we will support them as needed in responding to your request.

Resolution of Complaints. In compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles, Webbula commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. If you have any concerns or complaints, please contact us as described at the end of this Privacy Notice, and we will work with you to resolve your issue. Webbula has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to ANA, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit  ANA at EU US or Swiss Privacy Shield for Consumers – Data Compliance for more information or to file a complaint. The services of ANA are provided at no cost to you. Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website https://www.privacyshield.gov, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

If you have any questions please contact ANA at:
