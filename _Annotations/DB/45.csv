ra3,"We collect or receive information in several different ways. In many cases you choose what information to provide.\n\nA. Directly from You. We collect a variety of information from you when you provide it to us directly or when we request it from you. Some examples of these instances are as follows:\n\nPersonal Data that you Provide to Us. We receive, store, and collect any Personal Data you provide to us directly through one of our websites or give us in any other way, including business cards, emails, and telephone communications. For example, when you fill out and submit a registration form to become a TechTarget member, download a specific piece of content, request a walkthrough or demonstration of one of our products or services, or if you have expressed interest in a trade show in which TechTarget participated or hosted and had your badge scanned as part of your attendance at such event, then we received your contact information including your company, name, work address, business email, phone number, job information, and geographic location. We may ask you for similar information at other times, such as when you apply for a job through our websites or use our “Contact Us” or “Ask an Expert” forms.\nInformation About Others Who May be Interested in Our Content or Websites. Our websites may include an “email-a-friend” or “share this” feature, which allows someone to email or send content to a third party. If you utilize the feature, we will only use the email address of the intended recipient for purposes of emailing the respective content to that person. You should never share another person’s Personal Information with others without first receiving their permission.\nMember Generated Content. Some websites feature member generated content in the form of a member review section or forum communities. In order to interact in these forums, an individual must first complete the applicable registration form. The information provided by the individual may be displayed in the individual’s public profile in our forums and can be viewed by all visitors to the website. To ensure individuals’ privacy, we do not display any the email addresses of individuals who have commented in such forums or who have contributed such content.\nB. Third Party Service Providers and Partners. We engage third party service providers and partners to provide us with information, and we also use publicly available sources, to supplement our member account information to help improve personalization of our Premium Services. For example:\n\nSupplementary and Third Party Information. We may collect, obtain, or supplement your Personal Data from third parties who license it to us or otherwise provide it to us. This may include information provided through telephone, mailings, or events, from customers, vendors, suppliers, third parties, or commercially available sources (e.g., data brokers, data aggregators, public databases, etc.), and from third party partners or affiliates running co-branded campaigns or membership initiatives. For example, we may contract with a third-party partner or affiliate to contact you by email or telephone to determine if you would be interested in certain content tailored to your professional interest and/or becoming a member.\nPublic and Social Network Sources. We may collect or obtain your Personal Data from publicly accessible sources like corporate websites, business listings, or social networking platforms. You can opt-out of the third parties’ (such as a social media network or advertiser platform) collection and use of information for ad targeting by updating your account ad settings with the third party or by following the instructions regarding Tracking Technologies described in the paragraph below.\nC. Cookies and Other Tracking Tools. We use Cookies, Clear GIFs, Web Beacons, Tracking Technologies or other similar solutions (“Tracking Technologies”) to collect or receive certain information when you visit or use a TechTarget website or read an email, newsletter, or otherwise interact with content from us. These Tracking Technologies may include first party cookies (i.e., those placed by the website being visited) and third party cookies (i.e., those placed by a website other than the one being visited), local shared objects (commonly referred to as “Flash Cookies” or “HTML 5 Cookies”) and tracking pixels (including transparent or clear gifs).\n\nCookies are small data files which are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or use an online service. For example, cookies enable us to identify and authenticate you and remember your preferences so we can enhance your experience on our websites. They also help us serve you ads relevant to your professional interests and to provide aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for advertisers, understand and improve our service, and know when content has been shown to you. Because your web browser may request advertisements and beacons directly from third party ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set third party cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. Ads served by TechTarget may also set third party cookies. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.\n\nWe strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of TechTarget’s website features and if you decline or delete them then parts of our website and Premium Services may not work properly. Even if you decline or delete cookies, you will continue to be served with advertisements; however, they will not be tailored to your preferences, usage patterns or professional interests. Where legally permitted, we will assume that you have agreed to receive all cookies on our websites through your continued use; otherwise, your acceptance of such cookies by way of your browser settings or our consent management tool shall be deemed your acceptance of the use of such Tracking Technologies.\n\nTechTarget and its Partners use several different types of cookies on our websites, including the following.\n\nStrictly Necessary Cookies. Strictly necessary cookies facilitate the operation of our websites. Without the use of these cookies, portions of our websites would not function properly. For example, we use essential cookies to help us identify which of our visitors have previously registered in order to access our Premium Services.\nPerformance Cookies. Performance cookies help us monitor the performance of our websites and how users interact with them. These cookies collect information such as how often users visit our websites, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other websites they used prior to coming to our websites and provide us with information that allows us to improve our websites and services.\nFunctional Cookies. Functional cookies are used to remember your preferences on our websites and to authenticate your identity. For example, we use functional cookies to recognize and save your name and password on our websites.\nFlash Cookies. When you use one of our websites that employs Macromedia Flash Player, a small Flash Cookie may be used. The purpose of using these cookies is to store your flash player preferences and enhance your browsing experience.\nBehavioral Advertising Cookies. TechTarget and its Partners use behavioral advertising cookies in order to provide you with advertising which is tailored to your interests when you visit websites on and off our network. Behavioral advertising cookies analyze information about your interests and your browsing history and provide you with advertisements on and off our network that match these interests. Behavioral advertising is a type of advertising that is based upon your web browsing activity over a period of time – so it’s different than advertising you may see when you’re looking for something online using a search engine (e.g., Google, Yahoo, or Bing) or on a website you may be visiting at a particular time. As an example, you may be doing research on products and services related to data center virtualization. If a data center virtualization provider is conducting an advertising campaign on our network, as you browse the relevant portions of our websites, then we may serve you with an advertisement of one of their solutions.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
