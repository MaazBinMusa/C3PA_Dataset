ra2,"How We Use the Information\n\nHWD uses the Information for various purposes, including the following.\n\nAs Part of Our Services:\n\nData Marketing Services: Our Services include providing marketing information to our customers, generally regarding which customers or prospective customers are most likely to be interested (or disinterested) in certain offers, or how to best contact or identify those customers. Similarly, we help our customers identify and understand their customers better, by providing insights about them. Our customers include (but are not limited to) brands and agencies and various marketing data platforms that help analyze, market and advertise to their own customers (and prospective customers); our customers may also include other data compilers, who work with their own customers.\n\nOnline Targeting: We sometimes create defined audience segments (“Audience Segments”) based on common demographics and/or shared (actual or inferred) interests or preferences (e.g., households with healthcare professionals, or with an interest in international travel). When we do this, we may work with a data partner that “matches” our Information through de-identification techniques (such as through coded data “hashing”) with online cookies and other identifiers, in order to target and measure ad campaigns online across various display, mobile and other media channels. You may learn more about how to opt out of this and other online ad targeting in Section 4.\n\nIdentity Products: We sometimes collaborate with partners who use the Information we collect to create (or to help our customers create) “identity” graphs, to help locate users across various channels, such as based on common personal, device-based, or network-based identifiers (e.g., IP address, email address).\n\nAdditional Marketing Services: Other Services we may sometimes provide to our customers (or that they may provide to their own customers), which may overlap with or supplement the above, may involve (a) help with targeting and optimizing direct mail, email campaigns, display, social and mobile marketing; (b) measuring how effective marketing campaigns have been, by determining which messages are most likely to be seen or opened by which types of consumers, or which types of ads are most likely to lead to purchases; or (c) analyzing and optimizing our customers’ (or their service providers’) proprietary databases.\n\nTo Operate Our Services\n\nWe also use the Information for our own internal purposes – such as to improve, test, update, and verify our own database; to develop new products; and to operate, analyze, improve, and secure our Services and our databases and servers.",Categories of Personal Information Collected

It may also include information (on the individual, household, or geographic level), such as:\n\nProfessional information, including occupation and job title\n\nParticular interests, such as (for instance) home improvement, music, online shopping, health and beauty, sport, travel, or political leanings\n\nOrganizations to which you belong or have belonged, such as a cycling club, or to which you have contributed\n\nPublicly available information, such as that available from government information and files\n\nDemographic information, such as age, gender, level of education, or likely income range\n\nUsing this information, powered by analytics, we develop predictions of consumer health & wellness, and project it out to the US population  \n\nThis type of information may be inferred – for instance, if a household is in a particularly wealthy area, we might infer a particular income range; if a person’s name is “Catherine” we might infer gender as likely female.",Categories of Personal Information Collected

Similarly, we help our customers identify and understand their customers better, by providing insights about them. Our customers include (but are not limited to) brands and agencies and various marketing data platforms that help analyze, market and advertise to their own customers (and prospective customers); our customers may also include other data compilers, who work with their own customers.\n\nOnline Targeting: We sometimes create defined audience segments (“Audience Segments”) based on common demographics and/or shared (actual or inferred) interests or preferences (e.g., households with healthcare professionals, or with an interest in international travel). When we do this, we may work with a data partner that “matches” our Information through de-identification techniques (such as through coded data “hashing”) with online cookies and other identifiers, in order to target and measure ad campaigns online across various display, mobile and other media channels. You may learn more about how to opt out of this and other online ad targeting in Section 4.\n\nIdentity Products: We sometimes collaborate with partners who use the Information we collect to create (or to help our customers create) “identity” graphs, to help locate users across various channels, such as based on common personal, device-based, or network-based identifiers (e.g., IP address, email address).\n\nAdditional Marketing Services: Other Services we may sometimes provide to our customers (or that they may provide to their own customers), which may overlap with or supplement the above, may involve (a) help with targeting and optimizing direct mail, email campaigns, display, social and mobile marketing; (b) measuring how effective marketing campaigns have been, by determining which messages are most likely to be seen or opened by which types of consumers, or which types of ads are most likely to lead to purchases; or (c) analyzing and optimizing our customers’ (or their service providers’) proprietary databases.\n\nTo Operate Our Services\n\nWe also use the Information for our own internal purposes – such as to improve, test, update, and verify our own database; to develop new products; and to operate, analyze, improve, and secure our Services and our databases and servers.",Categories of Personal Information Collected
