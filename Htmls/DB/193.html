We focus on delivery of online advertisements (“Ads”). This may include “native” Ads, which refers to content (which may be a textual article, an image and/or a video) that adopts the look and feel of adjacent editorial content, but that is separately labeled as sponsored or advertising content. It may also include more traditional digital Ads (e.g., a banner Ad displayed at the top or along the side of a website). </p><p>Our technology enables us to ensure that you see Ads on Publishers’ websites and mobile apps (“Publisher Properties”) that we, Publishers and Advertisers think you would prefer to see, based on your previous interaction with other Publisher Properties and the Advertiser’s websites and mobile apps (“Advertiser Properties” and collectively with Publisher Properties “Properties”). This decision is made based on online activity associated with: </p><ul role="list"><li>In the context of web users – a unique identifier (which is resettable) assigned to a particular cookie (a “Cookie ID”) we place on your device (the “Nativo Cookie”); or </li><li>In the context of mobile users – mobile advertising IDs (such as iOS Advertising Identifiers and Google’s Advertising IDs), these are unique identifiers (which are resettable) set by the applicable mobile operating system provider (“Mobile Advertising IDs”). </li></ul><p>To enable us to provide these services we have developed software for Publishers and Advertisers to integrate into their Properties. This software, together with the Nativo Cookie we set, enables us to: </p><ul role="list"><li>display tailored Ads to you when you visit Publisher Properties; &nbsp;</li><li>collect and build certain User Profile Records tied to information associated with your current Cookie ID or Mobile Advertising ID – the meaning of the term ‘User Profile Records’ can be found here; </li><li>limit the number of times you see a particular Ad; and &nbsp;</li><li>measure the effectiveness of Ads and other Advertiser content. </li></ul><p>‍</p></div><div id="cookies" class="rich-text-block w-richtext"><h4>Cookies.</h4><p>The Nativo Cookie we set is a ‘persistent’ browser cookie. This means the Nativo Cookie remains on your device even after you close out of your browser or turn off your device. </p><p>Nativo uses this Nativo Cookie to help us store basic information about a user of website-based Properties. This enables us to either: </p><ul role="list"><li>identify that user when we see them on a different Property; or </li><li>remember not to serve that user targeted Ads if they opt out. </li></ul><p>To be able to do the above, we need to collect: </p><ul role="list"><li>the Cookie ID; and </li><li>information about whether that user has opted-out or not. </li></ul><p>Effect of clearing your Cookies. </p><p>All the information we have about a web-based user is tied to the Cookie ID that is assigned to the Nativo Cookie currently placed on their device. If you clear your cookies, it will delete the Nativo Cookie and therefore the Cookie ID will no longer identify a cookie on your device. This means the next time you visit a Property, we will not recognize you or your device, we will treat you as an entirely new user we have never seen before and we will set the Nativo Cookie (together with a new Cookie ID) again. </p><p><strong>Important note:</strong> if you clear or reject cookies, you will also clear the Nativo Cookie that lets us know that you have opted out of Nativo’s Ads. So, if you’ve previously opted out and clear/reset your cookies, you will need to opt out again – following the steps outlined <a href="https://www.nativo.com/interest-based-ads#your-rights">here</a>. </p><p><strong>Expiry date of the Nativo Cookie.</strong> </p><p>The Nativo Cookie expires: a year following the time at which you last viewed an Ad we served. </p><p>‍</p></div><div id="mobile-advertising-ids" class="rich-text-block w-richtext"><h4>Mobile Advertising IDs.</h4><p>Nativo collects Mobile Advertising IDs to help us store basic information about users of mobile app-based Properties. This enables us to identify that user when we see them on a different mobile app-based Property. To be able to do that, we need to collect the Mobile Advertising ID itself. </p><p><strong>Effect of resetting your Mobile Advertising ID. </strong></p><p>All the information we have about a mobile-based user is tied to their current Mobile Advertising ID. If you reset your Mobile Advertising ID, the next time you visit a mobile app-based Property, we will not recognize you or your device, we will treat you as an entirely new user we have never seen before, and we will collect your new Mobile Advertising ID.</p><p>‍</p></div><div id="your-rights" class="rich-text-block w-richtext"><h4>What "Your Rights" are (including your 'opt-out' rights).</h4><p><strong>Opting-out from your Desktop Browser. </strong><br> You can opt out of all targeting of any Ads by all Advertisers using Nativo’s services using Personal Data collected on your browser by clicking below:</p><div class="w-embed"><button class="button w-button" id="optInButton">OPT IN</button>
