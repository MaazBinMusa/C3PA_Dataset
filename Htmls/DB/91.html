Such data may include information about the number of purchases, items purchased, and cost of those purchases, but does not include things like name, email or Personal Information from the transaction.</p><p><b>Data about consumers' behaviors on our Clients' websites</b>, which we collect from our Clients. Such data may include information about whether a consumer performed certain actions on the Client's website – for example, whether a consumer clicked certain links or visited certain pages.</p><p><b>Geolocation data</b>, which we collect from a commercial subscription database. </p><h4>1.5 Cookies</h4><p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
