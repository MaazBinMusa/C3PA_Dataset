You may also make a verifiable    consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>  <p class="list-item">You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.

We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make    the request. For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights, below. </p>  <p class="list-item bold"><strong>Response Timing and Format </strong></p>  <p class="list-item">CheckSecrets will endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt.

If you are not a current customer, we will deliver our written response by mail or    electronically, at your option.</p>  <p class="list-item">Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data    portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>  <p class="list-item">CheckSecrets will not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you    why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>  <p class="list-item bold">Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</p>    <p class="list-item">If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the "right to opt-out"). CheckSecrets does not sell the personal information of consumers we      actually know are less than 18 years of age as CheckSecrets’s <a href="/terms" onclick="return window.pubFunc.app.click(event)">Terms of Use</a> state that if you are under 18 years of age, or if you are not the age of majority in your jurisdiction of permanent residence, you      must leave the Site immediately.

We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.</p>    <p class="list-item bold">Non-Discrimination</p>    <p class="list-item">We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>    <ul>      <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>      <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>      <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>      <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>    </ul>    <p class="list-item">However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that <strong>can result</strong> in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably      relate to your personal information's value and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.</p>    <p class="list-item bold">Contact Information</p>    <p class="list-item">If you have any questions or comments about this California Privacy Rights Notice, the ways in which CheckSecrets collects and uses your information described herein, your choices and rights regarding such use, or wish      to exercise your rights under California law, please do not hesitate to contact us at:</p>    <ul>      <li>Phone: (855) 754-7951</li>      <li>Website: www.checksecrets.com</li>      <li>Email: <a href="/contact-us" onclick="return window.pubFunc.app.click(event)">email us</a></li>      <li>Postal Address: Truth Now LLC, ATTN: CheckSecrets Privacy, 3746 Foothill Blvd #7060, Glendale, CA 91214</li>    </ul></div></div></uxtemplate></div></div></div></div><footer _ngcontent-dvs-c178="" class="footer"><app-sales-footer _ngcontent-dvs-c178="" _nghost-dvs-c57=""><!----><!----><div _ngcontent-dvs-c57="" class="container-fluid footer"><div _ngcontent-dvs-c57="" class="container"><div _ngcontent-dvs-c57="" class="row"><div _ngcontent-dvs-c57="" class="col-md-5"><div _ngcontent-dvs-c57="" class="row"><div _ngcontent-dvs-c57="" class="col-md-6"><ul _ngcontent-dvs-c57=""><li _ngcontent-dvs-c57=""><a _ngcontent-dvs-c57="" id="link-contact-us" href="/contact">Contact Us</a></li><li _ngcontent-dvs-c57=""><a _ngcontent-dvs-c57="" id="link-opt-out" href="/optOut/name/landing">Do Not Sell My Info</a></li><li _ngcontent-dvs-c57=""><a _ngcontent-dvs-c57="" id="link-opt-out" href="/affiliate">Become an Affiliate</a></li></ul></div><div _ngcontent-dvs-c57="" class="col-md-6"><ul _ngcontent-dvs-c57=""><li _ngcontent-dvs-c57=""><a _ngcontent-dvs-c57="" id="link-term" href="/terms">Terms of Use</a></li><li _ngcontent-dvs-c57=""><a _ngcontent-dvs-c57="" id="link-privacy" href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a></li></ul></div></div><!----></div><div _ngcontent-dvs-c57="" class="col-md-7"><uxtemplate _ngcontent-dvs-c57=""><div class="search-text-before ux" id="ux-4" data-key="comp.brand.disclosure" data-id="5f3cb8ff891c5e635cc369b6">Copyright @ 2023 Truth Now LLC All Rights Reserved<br>By using our content, products &amp; services you agree to our <a href="/terms" onclick="return window.pubFunc.app.click(event)">Terms Of Use</a>, and <a href="/privacy" onclick="return window.pubFunc.app.click(event)">Privacy Policy</a>.<br>Reproduction in whole or in part without express written permission of Truth Now LLC is prohibited.</div></uxtemplate></div></div></div></div><ux-2-0-landinglightbox _ngcontent-dvs-c57=""><div id="landing-lightbox" role="dialog" data-keyboard="false" data-backdrop="static" class="modal"><div class="modal-dialog"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-container"><div class="notification-modal"><div class="notification-modal-header"><div class="notification-modal-heading"><uxtemplate><div class="search-text-before ux" id="ux-5" data-key="comp.landing.lightbox.headline"></div></uxtemplate></div></div><div class="notification-modal-body"><uxtemplate><div class="search-text-before ux" id="ux-6" data-key="comp.landing.lightbox.text"></div></uxtemplate><button id="button-landing-lightbox" data-dismiss="modal" class="notification-modal-btn w-inline-block"><uxtemplate><div class="search-text-before ux" id="ux-7" data-key="comp.landing.lightbox.button"></div></uxtemplate></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><!----></ux-2-0-landinglightbox><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----></app-sales-footer><app-sales-disclaimer _ngcontent-dvs-c178=""><uxtemplate><div class="search-text-before ux" id="ux-3" data-key="comp.sales.general.privacy.disclaimer.text" data-id="62069599cdeed6a40836e293"><div class="container">  <div class="row" style="padding-bottom:50px;">    <div class="col-xs-12">Disclaimer: The CheckSecrets mission is to give people easy and affordable access to public record information, but CheckSecrets does not provide private investigator services or consumer reports, and is not a consumer reporting agency per the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
