	<h3>Why and How We Collect and Use Personal Data and Other Information</h3>

	<p>In order to operate the Services and to maximize your experience, we may collect and use information, some of which may be considered personal data. Additionally, we use your personal data in order to:</p>

	<ul style="margin-bottom: 16px">
		<li>Facilitate your access to and use of the Services, including personalizing the Services, features and content;</li>
		<li>Analyze and measure how you use the Services;</li>
		<li>Deliver personalized advertising and measure the effectiveness of advertisements;</li>
		<li>Manage Services’ operations;</li>
		<li>Help diagnose technical problems;</li>
		<li>Recognize repeat visitors;</li>
		<li>Provide location-based services (see <a href="/company/privacy-policy#section1D">Section 1.D.</a> below for further details); and</li>
		<li>Provide alerts and notifications.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Please note that you may choose not to provide us with certain information; by doing so, however, you may not be able to receive the full range of Services from us. We collect information in the following ways:</p>

	<ol type="A">
		<li id="section1A">
		<p><em>User Account and Weather Stations Registration.</em> When you choose to register an account, you will be required to provide your e-mail address. You may also register a weather station using your name and location of the station. If we can use information, alone or in combination, to reasonably identify you as an individual, we treat the information as personal data.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="section1B">
		<p><em>Information Provided by You.</em> You may choose to provide us with information, some of which may be personal data, when you interact with the Services in the following ways:</p>

		<ul style="margin-bottom: 16px">
			<li>Send us an email message or complete an inquiry form — for example, you might email us for customer support (see <a href="/company/privacy-policy#11">Section 11</a> ) or to initiate a data rights request (see <a href="/company/privacy-policy#06">Section 6</a>), and we will only use your email address to respond;</li>
			<li>Submit a comment, leave feedback, or send us a photo or video — for example, you might submit a photo of a weather event that we may post on the Services so others can enjoy it.<br>
			Special Note about Content Submissions. The Services may from time to time offer areas where you and other users can post or otherwise submit information, photos, videos, graphics, creative suggestions, ideas, notes, concepts, information, ratings or other materials on or to the Services (collectively, "Submissions"). Any geolocation information, tags, or other metadata in Submissions may become publicly available. Any information, including personal data, in your Submissions can be read, collected, or used by others. We cannot control and are not responsible for how others may use the information contained in your Submissions;</li>
			<li>Interact with the Services — we may collect information you provide when you interact with content available on our Services; for example, you might set a “home” location so that every time you visit the Services, you are automatically displayed the weather for that home location, or you may choose to interact with optional polls or surveys; and we may use that information to personalize the Services you visit, analyze and measure how you use the Services, deliver personalized advertising and measure the effectiveness of advertisements; and</li>
			<li>Engage with interactive advertising — we may receive the information you provide when you submit oral or written questions or comments via the interactive ads that are placed on the Services or on third-party platforms; and we may share this information with our advertisers where required by applicable law.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li id="section1C">
		<p><em>Automatic Collection.</em> We also collect certain information through automated means.<br>
		Some of the information we collect through automated means may, whether alone or combined with other data, be personal data. For example, we automatically collect:</p>

		<ul style="margin-bottom: 16px">
			<li>Information about your device and device capabilities;</li>
			<li>Information about your device operating system;</li>
			<li>Information about your browser;</li>
			<li>Information about how you use and interact with the Services;</li>
			<li>Your activities on the Services;</li>
			<li>IP address;</li>
			<li>Advertising identifiers;</li>
			<li>Mobile or Internet Carrier;</li>
			<li>Browser type;</li>
			<li>Browser identifier; and</li>
			<li>Referring URL.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li id="section1D">
		<p><em>Location Information.</em> We may collect location information to provide you with location-based services (such as severe weather alerts, air quality, and other weather information), and conduct analytics to improve the Services. We may also use the collected location information to show you content (including advertisements) that are relevant to your geographic location. The type of location information we collect depends on your settings in the device you use to access the Services.</p>

		<ul style="margin-bottom: 16px">
			<li><strong>Web/Mobile Web Use of Location Information –</strong> If you are accessing the Services through the Site, including via your mobile web browser, we may detect your general location based on your device’s IP address information, so that we can automatically show you the weather for your approximated area. Depending on browser type and configuration, your browser may inform you that the Site would like to collect your specific location and request your permission to do so. Specific location may consist of the precise geographic location. If the collection is allowed on mobile web, it may be derived from the Global Positioning System (GPS). If you do not consent to the collection of specific location, or your browser blocks the collection by default, only your general location information is then collected and may be stored locally on your device. You can always manually enter a location (such as city, postal code, and country). If you opt out of sharing your current location, you may continue to receive content, including advertisements, that is contextual to the latest location you have searched (i.e., “contextual location”)</li>
			<li><strong>Mobile App Use of Location Information -</strong> If you access the Services on your mobile device and consent to sharing location information with our mobile application, we may directly collect precise geographic location information and sensor data via Global Positioning System (GPS), cellular network information, and other location-based features. We typically receive the latitude and longitude of your mobile device, as well as date and time and sensor data such as altimeter. Factors such as device and operating system determine the accuracy of this latitude and longitude and how closely it corresponds with your device’s location. If you allow the Weather Underground mobile application to directly collect location information while the mobile application is running in the background, you will enable continuous location collection. This may allow us to send you severe weather alerts for the area in which you might be traveling, in addition to other Services. You can turn off direct location collection (or, on some operating systems, continuous direct location collection) through your device settings or by deleting the mobile application from your device. If you turn off location-based services, you may continue using the Services by manually entering a location into the search bar. When you disable direct location collection, you may continue to receive alerts and advertisements based on your contextual location. Contextual location for mobile apps is an approximated location derived from the latest location stored by the Services (e.g., last searched location), prior to turning off direct location collection.</li>
			<li><strong>Data Vendor Use of Location Information - </strong> Our service providers, and Advertising and Analytics Vendors (see <a href="/company/privacy-policy#02">Section 2</a> for more information) may also collect location information through the Services. We may share the location information we collect with third parties as addressed in <a href="/company/privacy-policy#03">Section 3</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li id="section1E">
		<p><em>Alerts and Notifications.</em> Certain Services offer you the ability to receive push notifications for weather-related or product updates, news stories, and special offers. To provide these Services, we may need to collect your device information and/or mobile carrier information, in addition to the postcode or geographic area to which the alert, update, or notification pertains.<br>
		<br>
		If you no longer wish to receive these types of notifications, you may opt out by turning them off within the settings of your mobile device or the particular Service for which you registered, or by deleting the application.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="section1F">
		<p><em>Information from Analytics and Advertising Vendors and Advertisers.</em> Where legally permissible, we may obtain information about you or your use of the Services from Analytics and Advertising Vendors (see <a href="/company/privacy-policy#02">Section 2</a>) and advertisers. We may combine the information you provide us and information we automatically collect with information from public or third-party sources. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personal data that we collect through the Services, we will treat the combined information as personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

	<li id="02">
	<h3>Data Collection Technologies and Consumer Choice</h3>

	<p>We and third parties acting on our behalf, or on behalf of advertisers or vendors, use various technologies that help us to manage the operations of our Services and track usage behavior. These technologies enable us to tailor information and advertisements to make your visits more meaningful and to offer accurate forecast data to everyone, everywhere, free of charge. We follow the self-regulatory principles of the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"), the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada ("DAAC"), and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance ("EDAA").</p>

	<p>We work with a variety of advertising services that use various technologies to collect data about your use of the Services (such as content viewed or ads clicked on) on our behalf or on behalf of advertisers (Advertising Vendors) in order to serve relevant ads. Advertising Vendors use various technologies on the Services to (among other purposes): track how the Services are used, what pages or content users interact with, and what sites or mobile applications users interact with after they leave the Services; link users' devices (i.e., cross-device or cross-platform tracking); and serve more relevant ads on and within the Services or other websites or mobile applications that you visit. Advertising Vendors may combine this data with other information they may have obtained from you or from other sources that is unrelated to your use of the Services in order to target and measure the effectiveness of advertisements. More information about this type of advertising that is tailored to your likely interests based on your activities across other apps or websites (“personalized advertising”) is available from the <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-is-it/." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Network Advertising Initiative's website</a>.</p>

	<p>We also work with certain entities that use data collection technologies to track, analyze, and report data about the use of the Services and to analyze and optimize the performance of the Services ("Analytics Vendors").</p>

	<p>Information collected via the data collection technologies described in this section may be linked to other information about you such as location information and may be considered personal data. We and our vendors may use the technologies described in this section, alone or in combination, to understand user behavior, target and measure the effectiveness of advertisements, help diagnose problems, recognize repeat visitors, and facilitate your access to and use of the Services.</p>

	<ol type="A">
		<li id="section2A">
		<p><em>Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Information Saved by Other Technologies</em></p>

		<p>Third parties may use cookies and other technologies through use of our Services to support or deliver personalized advertising on third-party websites and online services. The data collection technologies we and third parties use on web include but are not limited to:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
			<p><strong>Cookies:</strong> Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website and stored within your browser. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit to that website or to another website that recognizes those cookies. Some cookies on our Services collect IP and MAC addresses, which may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user's device. For more information, please visit this <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">“All About Cookies”</a> guide. The cookies used on this website can be categorized in the following ways:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
				<p>Category 1: Strictly Necessary Cookies</p>

				<p>These cookies are essential in order to enable you to use the Services and its features.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>Category 2: Performance Cookies</p>

				<p>These cookies collect information about how you use the Services (such as which pages you go to most often and if you receive error messages). In general, these cookies do not collect information that directly identifies you. However, some such cookies may collect GeoIP or other identifiers that may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>Category 3: Functionality Cookies</p>

				<p>These cookies allow Services to remember choices you make (such as language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced features (such as local weather reports or traffic news). These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to customize the Services.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>Category 4: Targeting Cookies</p>

				<p>These cookies collect several pieces of information about your browsing habits. They are often placed by advertising networks rather than website operators. They collect information about your interactions over time with the Services as well as with third-party websites and online services. This information may be shared with other organizations such as advertisers in order to provide you with advertisements that may be more relevant to you based on your inferred interests.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p>Category 5: Social Network Cookies</p>

				<p>These cookies are generally generated by content embeds. They allow social network users to share content and use other features such as publishing comments.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><strong>Web beacons:</strong> Certain pages on the Services contain web beacons also known as web bugs, pixel tags, or clear GIFs. Web beacons allow third parties to obtain information, such as the IP address of the computer that accessed the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies sent by the third party.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p><strong>Web Storage:</strong> We use local storage, to enhance user experience by, for example, storing your user preferences and settings (e.g., volume/mute) in connection with animated content on the Services. Local storage is similar to browser cookies but can store data more complex than simple text. By itself, local storage cannot do anything to or with the data stored on your device.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li id="section2B">
		<p><em>Use of Advertising Identifiers</em></p>

		<p>We and our Advertising Vendors may collect information about usage of mobile applications via advertising identifiers to support or deliver personalized advertising. An advertising identifier is a randomly generated alphanumeric code associated with a user's device. Advertising identifiers provide advertisers a way to identify a user's device without using a permanent device identifier, such as serial number.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="section2C">
		<p><em>Your Choices Around Cookies, Advertising Identifiers, and Other Technologies Used by Vendors</em></p>

		<p>You have the ability to control how your data is used, including for personalized advertising, in the following ways:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><em>Vendors:</em> This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of our vendors outside of our Services and we do not control our vendors’ technologies. We provide links to more information about our vendors’ privacy practices and any available opt outs <a href="/data-vendors">here</a>.</li>
			<li><em>Browser settings:</em> Your web browser may allow you to manage your cookies and local storage to control access to data about your online activity. We encourage you to check your browser’s “Help” feature to learn how to block, disable, and delete cookies. Please note that for technical reasons, if you delete or block certain cookies, some features of the site may be unavailable or may not function as intended. For more information, please visit this <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“All About Cookies” guide</a> on managing cookies.</li>
			<li><em>Device settings:</em> The Android and iOS versions 6 to 13 mobile device operating systems allow you to control how your device’s advertising identifier is used to support or deliver personalized advertising. The iOS versions 14 and above mobile device operating systems allow you to control use of the advertising identifier and “tracking;” learn about tracking from Apple at Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Tracking &gt; Learn More
			<ul>
				<li>Android device settings (version 2.3 and above): “Opt out of Ads Personalization” by following the instructions provided by Google <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/3405269" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
				<li>iOS device settings (versions 6 to 13): “Limit Ad Tracking” at Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Advertising &gt; Limit Ad Tracking</li>
				<li>iOS device settings (versions 14 and above): “Tracking” permissions at Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Tracking</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The opt outs described above are device- or browser-specific and may not be available for all devices. So, if you opt out on your mobile device, you may continue to receive personalized advertising on your desktop computer or other devices. If you choose to opt out, you will still see ads, but the ads will not be based on your activities across other apps and websites you use.</p>

		<p>You can also opt out of future information collection from the Services by adjusting the settings on your device, ceasing use of the Service on web, or un-installing the relevant mobile application.</p>

		<p><em>Industry Group Opt-Outs:</em> Some industry organizations offer centralized tools where you can opt out of the use of your data by multiple vendors at once. For more information about Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt-out tools to assist you in managing choices for participating companies that use cookies, visit the following sites:</p>

		<p>Also, the DAA offers AppChoices, a separate choice tool for users to exercise control over the collection and use of data through mobile applications for personalized advertising and other related uses. To exercise choice for participating companies, you can install the DAA's AppChoices application on your mobile device. Visit <a href="http://youradchoices.com/appchoices" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> for more information on DAA's AppChoices tool.</p>

		<p>Information collected via the data collection technologies described in this section may be linked to other information about you such as location information and may be considered personal data. We and vendors may use the technologies described in this section, alone or in combination, to understand user behavior, target and measure the effectiveness of advertisements, help diagnose problems, recognize repeat visitors, and facilitate your access to and use of the Services.</p>

		<p><em>Do Not Track:</em> Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services. At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for recognizable DNT signals, and in general the signal has yet to gain widespread acceptance. As a result, we will not recognize requests coming through as DNT signals. We, however, do recognize and honor Global Privacy Control.</p>

	<h3>How We Share or Disclose Your Information with Vendors</h3>

	<p>We may also share any information collected from the Services including aggregated or statistical data that we may generate from such information in the following ways:</p>

	<ol type="A">
		<li id="section3A">
		<p><em>Service Providers.</em> When your data is collected on the Services, it may be shared with select Analytics Vendors and Advertising Vendors that assist us with marketing or advertising campaigns for our brands, and providers of services that assist us with our business operations, with the provision of the Services, or in delivering you the features and functionality that you have requested ("Technology Vendors"). These service providers include companies that support our advertising programs for our brands, provide data storage, support customer service, assist with audience research and product development, facilitate or deliver materials to you, and provide map content for the Services. Our service providers are authorized to use the data that we provide to them only to carry out and improve the service they are providing for us. All such service providers are contractually bound by us to keep the data confidential.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="section3B">
		<p><em>Companies Offering Promotions, Products, or Services.</em> At times, we will provide you with the opportunity to choose to receive promotions, products, or services from third-party sponsors. We also may provide you with the opportunity to receive products and services directly from specifically identified third parties through the Services. In these instances, you must explicitly consent to receive each offer. When you choose to receive offers from specific third parties, your information is shared with them to enable them to provide you with the offer you have requested. We are not responsible for the information collection practices of these third parties, and all information provided is governed by their privacy policies. You should review the privacy policies of these third parties before supplying personal data to them.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="section3C">
		<p><em>Other Websites, Other Services, Plug-Ins, and Links.</em> Like many websites on the Internet and other Internet-based services, the Services may link to webpages located on websites or services maintained by various other entities. In some cases, you may navigate to pages of other websites that are framed with elements of the Services such as in the header or footer or an interactive ad. In that case, the URL or prominent text on the other website will identify the site you are visiting. In other cases, such as advertisements, you will be connecting to another site or service when you click on or otherwise activate those opportunities, including click-to-call, click-to-text, and click-to-e-mail opportunities. These other sites and services are not bound by our Privacy Policy, and we are not responsible for their information collection practices. The privacy policies of other organizations may differ from ours, for example, with respect to the level of security, use of cookies, and collection, use and disclosure of personal data. Some of the Services allow users to interact with other websites or services. You may remain logged into those other sites and services until you log off. Your use of those other sites and services is subject to the privacy policies of those sites and services, and not this Privacy Policy.</p>

		<p>Some of the Services use third-party operating systems, platforms, communication services, devices, and software elements (such as mobile device operating systems, wireless services, mobile phone, and tablet devices), and some of the Services are provided by third-party distributors, device makers, device operators, platform operators, and communication services. We do not control these third-party entities, products, and services, and they may collect, use, process, transmit, and disclose your information. As we do not control these third-parties' data handling practices, we recommend that you review their privacy policies, terms of use, and license agreements (if any).</p>
		</li>
		<li id="section3D">
		<p><em>Advertising Vendors.</em> We may share information we collect with Advertising Vendors, including those used by our advertisers, so that they can: (i) deliver and/or support the delivery of relevant content or ads on our websites or apps, advertisers’ websites or apps, or other third-party websites or apps; (ii) analyze and report on content or ads users see or interact with, and; (iii) improve their services. Advertising Vendors may also collect information via the technologies discussed in <a href="/company/privacy-policy#02">Section 2</a> above or via interactive ads. The information may include data about how users interact with the Services, information users provide via interactive ads, the content and ads users have viewed, users' activities on other websites and online services, and physical places users have visited.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="section3E">
		<p><em>Purchase or Sale of Businesses.</em> We continually look for ways to improve our business, including purchasing a business or selling all or part of our business. If we buy, merge, reorganize or sell any business or assets, personal data and non-personal information will likely be disclosed or transferred as part of the transaction.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="section3F">
		<p><em>Aggregated Information.</em> As part of the Services, we may aggregate or otherwise alter information (including location information) that is collected from the Services so that it does not identify your device and cannot reasonably be linked to your device. We may use or share such information with third parties for research or commercial purposes (e.g., analyzing trends based on foot traffic). As explained in <a href="/company/privacy-policy#section1D">Section 1.D.</a> above, you can turn off the collection of location data through your device settings.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="section3G">
		<p><em>Personal Weather Station data.</em> If you contribute to the Weather Underground community by sharing your Personal Weather Station (PWS) sensor information, then data from your sensor may be shared for commercial purposes, including sensor location, per your acceptance during PWS registration.</p>

	<p>You can request to access, obtain a portable copy of, correct, or delete data related to your stored preferences and your use of the Services.

		<p>The CPRA defines the terms "sell" and "sale" broadly to include the sharing of Personal Information with third parties for something of value, even if no money is exchanged.

However, we do allow Advertising Vendors to use your Personal Information for certain purposes other than providing and improving advertising services for our apps and websites (described in <a href="/company/privacy-policy#section3D"> Section 3.D.</a> of our Privacy Policy), which is considered a sale under CPRA. This is the only way that we sell Personal Information under the CPRA, and we do not engage in any other sales of Personal Information under the CPRA. The CPRA also defines “share” and “sharing” to specifically mean the sharing of Personal Information with third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising.</p>

The Services may from time to time offer areas where you and other users can post or otherwise submit information, photos, videos, graphics, creative suggestions, ideas, notes, concepts, information, ratings or other materials on or to the Services (collectively, \&q;Submissions\&q;). Any geolocation information, tags, or other metadata in Submissions may become publicly available.

We may also use the collected location information to show you content (including advertisements) that are relevant to your geographic location. The type of location information we collect depends on your settings in the device you use to access the Services.&l;/p&g;\r\n\r\n\t\t&l;ul style=\&q;margin-bottom: 16px\&q;&g;\r\n\t\t\t&l;li&g;&l;strong&g;Web/Mobile Web Use of Location Information –&l;/strong&g; If you are accessing the Services through the Site, including via your mobile web browser, we may detect your general location based on your device’s IP address information, so that we can automatically show you the weather for your approximated area. Depending on browser type and configuration, your browser may inform you that the Site would like to collect your specific location and request your permission to do so. Specific location may consist of the precise geographic location. If the collection is allowed on mobile web, it may be derived from the Global Positioning System (GPS). If you do not consent to the collection of specific location, or your browser blocks the collection by default, only your general location information is then collected and may be stored locally on your device. You can always manually enter a location (such as city, postal code, and country). If you opt out of sharing your current location, you may continue to receive content, including advertisements, that is contextual to the latest location you have searched (i.e., “contextual location”)&l;/li&g;\r\n\t\t\t&l;li&g;&l;strong&g;Mobile App Use of Location Information -&l;/strong&g; If you access the Services on your mobile device and consent to sharing location information with our mobile application, we may directly collect precise geographic location information and sensor data via Global Positioning System (GPS), cellular network information, and other location-based features. We typically receive the latitude and longitude of your mobile device, as well as date and time and sensor data such as altimeter. Factors such as device and operating system determine the accuracy of this latitude and longitude and how closely it corresponds with your device’s location. If you allow the Weather Underground mobile application to directly collect location information while the mobile application is running in the background, you will enable continuous location collection. This may allow us to send you severe weather alerts for the area in which you might be traveling, in addition to other Services. You can turn off direct location collection (or, on some operating systems, continuous direct location collection) through your device settings or by deleting the mobile application from your device. If you turn off location-based services, you may continue using the Services by manually entering a location into the search bar. When you disable direct location collection, you may continue to receive alerts and advertisements based on your contextual location. Contextual location for mobile apps is an approximated location derived from the latest location stored by the Services (e.g., last searched location), prior to turning off direct location collection.&l;/li&g;\r\n\t\t\t&l;li&g;&l;strong&g;Data Vendor Use of Location Information - &l;/strong&g; Our service providers, and Advertising and Analytics Vendors (see &l;a href=\&q;/company/privacy-policy#02\&q;&g;Section 2&l;/a&g; for more information) may also collect location information through the Services. We may share the location information we collect with third parties as addressed in &l;a href=\&q;/company/privacy-policy#03\&q;&g;Section 3&l;/a&g;.&l;/li&g;\r\n\t\t&l;/ul&g;\r\n\t\t&l;/li&g;\r\n\t\t&l;li id=\&q;section1E\&q;&g;\r\n\t\t&l;p&g;&l;em&g;Alerts and Notifications.&l;/em&g; Certain Services offer you the ability to receive push notifications for weather-related or product updates, news stories, and special offers. To provide these Services, we may need to collect your device information and/or mobile carrier information, in addition to the postcode or geographic area to which the alert, update, or notification pertains.&l;br /&g;\r\n\t\t&l;br /&g;\r\n\t\tIf you no longer wish to receive these types of notifications, you may opt out by turning them off within the settings of your mobile device or the particular Service for which you registered, or by deleting the application.&l;/p&g;\r\n\t\t&l;/li&g;\r\n\t\t&l;li id=\&q;section1F\&q;&g;\r\n\t\t&l;p&g;&l;em&g;Information from Analytics and Advertising Vendors and Advertisers.&l;/em&g; Where legally permissible, we may obtain information about you or your use of the Services from Analytics and Advertising Vendors (see &l;a href=\&q;/company/privacy-policy#02\&q;&g;Section 2&l;/a&g;) and advertisers. We may combine the information you provide us and information we automatically collect with information from public or third-party sources. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personal data that we collect through the Services, we will treat the combined information as personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.&l;/p&g;\r\n\t\t&l;/li&g;\r\n\t&l;/ol&g;\r\n\t&l;/li&g;\r\n\t&l;li id=\&q;02\&q;&g;\r\n\t&l;h3&g;Data Collection Technologies and Consumer Choice&l;/h3&g;\r\n\r\n\t&l;p&g;We and third parties acting on our behalf, or on behalf of advertisers or vendors, use various technologies that help us to manage the operations of our Services and track usage behavior. These technologies enable us to tailor information and advertisements to make your visits more meaningful and to offer accurate forecast data to everyone, everywhere, free of charge. We follow the self-regulatory principles of the Digital Advertising Alliance (\&q;DAA\&q;), the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (\&q;DAAC\&q;), and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (\&q;EDAA\&q;).&l;/p&g;\r\n\r\n\t&l;p&g;We work with a variety of advertising services that use various technologies to collect data about your use of the Services (such as content viewed or ads clicked on) on our behalf or on behalf of advertisers (Advertising Vendors) in order to serve relevant ads. Advertising Vendors use various technologies on the Services to (among other purposes): track how the Services are used, what pages or content users interact with, and what sites or mobile applications users interact with after they leave the Services; link users&s; devices (i.e., cross-device or cross-platform tracking); and serve more relevant ads on and within the Services or other websites or mobile applications that you visit. Advertising Vendors may combine this data with other information they may have obtained from you or from other sources that is unrelated to your use of the Services in order to target and measure the effectiveness of advertisements. More information about this type of advertising that is tailored to your likely interests based on your activities across other apps or websites (“personalized advertising”) is available from the &l;a href=\&q;https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-is-it/.\&q; rel=\&q;noopener noreferrer\&q; target=\&q;_blank\&q;&g; Network Advertising Initiative&s;s website&l;/a&g;.&l;/p&g;\r\n\r\n\t&l;p&g;We also work with certain entities that use data collection technologies to track, analyze, and report data about the use of the Services and to analyze and optimize the performance of the Services (\&q;Analytics Vendors\&q;).&l;/p&g;\r\n\r\n\t&l;p&g;Information collected via the data collection technologies described in this section may be linked to other information about you such as location information and may be considered personal data.

Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit to that website or to another website that recognizes those cookies. Some cookies on our Services collect IP and MAC addresses, which may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user&s;s device.

They are often placed by advertising networks rather than website operators. They collect information about your interactions over time with the Services as well as with third-party websites and online services. This information may be shared with other organizations such as advertisers in order to provide you with advertisements that may be more relevant to you based on your inferred interests.&l;/p&g;\r\n\t\t\t\t&l;/li&g;\r\n\t\t\t\t&l;li&g;\r\n\t\t\t\t&l;p&g;Category 5: Social Network Cookies&l;/p&g;\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t&l;p&g;These cookies are generally generated by content embeds.

Web beacons allow third parties to obtain information, such as the IP address of the computer that accessed the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies sent by the third party.&l;/p&g;\r\n\t\t\t&l;/li&g;\r\n\t\t\t&l;li&g;\r\n\t\t\t&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;Web Storage:&l;/strong&g; We use local storage, to enhance user experience by, for example, storing your user preferences and settings (e.g., volume/mute) in connection with animated content on the Services. Local storage is similar to browser cookies but can store data more complex than simple text. By itself, local storage cannot do anything to or with the data stored on your device.&l;/p&g;\r\n\t\t\t&l;/li&g;\r\n\t\t&l;/ol&g;\r\n\t\t&l;/li&g;\r\n\t\t&l;li id=\&q;section2B\&q;&g;\r\n\t\t&l;p&g;&l;em&g;Use of Advertising Identifiers&l;/em&g;&l;/p&g;\r\n\r\n\t\t&l;p&g;We and our Advertising Vendors may collect information about usage of mobile applications via advertising identifiers to support or deliver personalized advertising.

These service providers include companies that support our advertising programs for our brands, provide data storage, support customer service, assist with audience research and product development, facilitate or deliver materials to you, and provide map content for the Services. Our service providers are authorized to use the data that we provide to them only to carry out and improve the service they are providing for us.

In these instances, you must explicitly consent to receive each offer. When you choose to receive offers from specific third parties, your information is shared with them to enable them to provide you with the offer you have requested.

In some cases, you may navigate to pages of other websites that are framed with elements of the Services such as in the header or footer or an interactive ad.

In other cases, such as advertisements, you will be connecting to another site or service when you click on or otherwise activate those opportunities, including click-to-call, click-to-text, and click-to-e-mail opportunities. These other sites and services are not bound by our Privacy Policy, and we are not responsible for their information collection practices. The privacy policies of other organizations may differ from ours, for example, with respect to the level of security, use of cookies, and collection, use and disclosure of personal data. Some of the Services allow users to interact with other websites or services. You may remain logged into those other sites and services until you log off. Your use of those other sites and services is subject to the privacy policies of those sites and services, and not this Privacy Policy.&l;/p&g;\r\n\r\n\t\t&l;p&g;Some of the Services use third-party operating systems, platforms, communication services, devices, and software elements (such as mobile device operating systems, wireless services, mobile phone, and tablet devices), and some of the Services are provided by third-party distributors, device makers, device operators, platform operators, and communication services. We do not control these third-party entities, products, and services, and they may collect, use, process, transmit, and disclose your information. As we do not control these third-parties&s; data handling practices, we recommend that you review their privacy policies, terms of use, and license agreements (if any).&l;/p&g;\r\n\t\t&l;/li&g;\r\n\t\t&l;li id=\&q;section3D\&q;&g;\r\n\t\t&l;p&g;&l;em&g;Advertising Vendors.&l;/em&g; We may share information we collect with Advertising Vendors, including those used by our advertisers, so that they can: (i) deliver and/or support the delivery of relevant content or ads on our websites or apps, advertisers’ websites or apps, or other third-party websites or apps; (ii) analyze and report on content or ads users see or interact with, and; (iii) improve their services. Advertising Vendors may also collect information via the technologies discussed in &l;a href=\&q;/company/privacy-policy#02\&q;&g;Section 2&l;/a&g; above or via interactive ads.

For a rainbow to form, water droplets must be present in the air in front of an observer and the sun must be shining from behind the observer. Rainbows result from the refraction and reflection of sunlight by these water droplets. (&l;/em&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://opensky.ucar.edu/islandora/object/imagegallery%3A371\&q;&g;&l;em&g;Bob Henson, via UCAR Digital Image Library&l;/em&g;&l;/a&g;&l;em&g;)&l;/em&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Given that the very first entry in Dr. Jeff Masters&a;rsquo; WunderBlog (the original name of this blog) was &a;ldquo;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/the-360degree-rainbow.html\&q;&g;The 360-degree Rainbow&l;/a&g;&a;rdquo;&a;mdash;see the full story in &l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/So-Long-Wunderground\&q;&g;Jeff&a;rsquo;s farewell post&l;/a&g; from October 2019&a;mdash;I thought it would be apropos for this final Category 6 entry to spotlight another, very different kind of rainbow. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;I took the photo above looking east-northeast while stopped on a drive across northwest Oklahoma in April 1991, with a severe thunderstorm in the distance. I&a;rsquo;d never seen a &a;ldquo;rainbow rise&a;rdquo; before, and I&a;rsquo;ve certainly never seen anything that was as distinct as this. Primary rainbows always form opposite the sun, with an imaginary line running from the sun through the observer&a;rsquo;s head to the center of the rainbow arc. So in order to see a rainbow near the horizon, the sun needs to be almost 42&a;deg; above the opposite horizon. That&s;s typically the case in the early to mid-afternoon (solar time) in midlatitude spring, as was the case on the stormy April day when I snapped this photo.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Rainbows are laden with symbolism, especially about places that lie beyond our human reckoning. When our pets die, we talk about them crossing the &a;ldquo;rainbow bridge.&a;rdquo; A 16-year-old Judy Garland sang longingly about a place &a;ldquo;over the rainbow&a;rdquo; in &a;ldquo;The Wizard of Oz&a;rdquo;&a;mdash;the most famous movie of all time in which a weather event (that mesmerizing tornado!) served as the central plot twist (no pun intended).&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;I like to think of the rainbow pictured above as symbolizing the multitudinous human colors and textures that have made this meeting place what it is. Collectively, our readers have contributed far more content to Category 6 than we regular authors have, and you&a;rsquo;ve made it a welcoming spot for people from many ages, many walks of life, and many corners of the planet. I can&a;rsquo;t do justice to all of you in a single farewell post, but I hope you will each consider this a heartfelt &a;ldquo;thank you&a;rdquo; for every weather tidbit you&a;rsquo;ve shared and every friendship you&a;rsquo;ve cultivated here. I hope you&a;rsquo;ll all sign the yearbook, as it were, in the Disqus comments below (and be sure to check out the moving testimonials at the &l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/end-of-an-era-category-6-to-close-shop-this-month\&q;&g;&a;ldquo;end of an era&a;rdquo; announcement post&l;/a&g; from June 10).&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;I&a;rsquo;m especially glad that this blog has been a place for serious discussion of human-produced climate change, the environmental issue of our lives. Since Jeff Masters started this blog in 2005, the global concentration of carbon dioxide has &l;a href=\&q;https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/wp-content/plugins/sio-bluemoon/graphs/mlo_full_record.png\&q;&g;risen&l;/a&g; from about 380 to 415 parts per million&a;mdash;an increase of nearly 10%. Methane concentrations have &l;a href=\&q;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_methane#/media/File:Mlo_ch4_ts_obs_03437.png\&q;&g;jumped&l;/a&g; from about 1780 to 1870 parts per billion. And global surface temperature has &l;a href=\&q;https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/global/time-series/globe/land_ocean/ytd/12/1880-2019?trend=true&a;amp;trend_base=10&a;amp;begtrendyear=2005&a;amp;endtrendyear=2020\&q;&g;spiked&l;/a&g; by a frightening 0.5&a;deg;F (0.3&a;deg;C). You&a;rsquo;ve read in our many posts about the consequences: heat- and drought-fueled wildfires, record rains from a juiced-up atmosphere, the effects of a warming planet on a vast range of ecosystems. As disasters typically do, the myriad impacts of climate change tend to hit those who are most vulnerable, including people of color, the hardest. We&a;rsquo;re not doing close to enough to keep this slow-motion catastrophe at bay.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/06/commentary-covid-19-is-the-quiz-climate-change-the-final-exam/\&q;&g;As Jeff put it&l;/a&g; this week in a post at &a;ldquo;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/section/eye-on-the-storm/\&q;&g;Eye on the Storm&l;/a&g;,&a;rdquo; his new blogging home:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;Many students&a;rsquo; recurring nightmares involve a final exam tomorrow for a course they seldom attended all term: They can&a;rsquo;t remember where the classroom is, and barely studied for the exam. Unfortunately, that nightmare describes humanity&a;rsquo;s situation for the coming climate change final exam. While the stakes for flunking the COVID-19 quiz have been crushing&a;mdash;over 425,000 people dead globally by mid-June, economies crippled, and an as-yet unrealized catastrophe looming for many nations in the developing world&a;mdash;the cost of failing our inevitable collective climate change final exam will be apocalyptic for civilization.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Here are a few more words from Dr. Masters on the occasion of Cat 6&a;rsquo;s final post:  &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;The sun has set upon the Weather Underground blog community.

(Humboldt State University)&l;/em&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;We have all read about famous scientists who helped to shape and steer our knowledge of the world.  Back in the 19th century, there were the likes of Charles Darwin, Louis Pasteur, Thomas Edison, Madame Curie, and many more whose contributions are well documented.  Then there are those names that may have not made it into our grade school and high school history books.  We may know them from other references, like a mountain or ocean current, such as the Humboldt Current off the coast of South America.  &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;I never really thought about who this &a;ldquo;Humboldt&a;rdquo; was and what his contributions might have been.  Coming from Buffalo, New York, I was familiar with places like Humboldt Park and the beautiful tree-lined road that once crossed the city, known as Humboldt Parkway.  &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Decades flew by, until one day in 2016 I was listening to an interview with a historian and author, Andrea Wulf, who had just published a book titled &l;a href=\&q;https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Invention_of_Nature/byjqBQAAQBAJ?hl=en&a;amp;gbpv=1&a;amp;printsec=frontcover\&q;&g;&l;em&g;The Invention of Nature&l;/em&g;&l;/a&g;.  As I listened, I nearly jumped off my chair to hear about the amazing life of the 19th-century Prussian naturalist Alexander von Humboldt.  In particular, I was fascinated with his connections to the science of meteorology and climatology. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;It turns out that Humboldt was one of the world&a;rsquo;s most famous scientists of his era, and a thinker ahead of his time in many ways. As Laura Dassow Walls put it in an American Scientist &l;a href=\&q;https://www.americanscientist.org/article/o-pioneer\&q;&g;review&l;/a&g; of &l;em&g;The Invention of Nature&l;/em&g;, &a;ldquo;How on earth did we ever lose sight of Alexander von Humboldt?&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn0\&q; /&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;Bringing it together&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;Science was beginning to advance more and more rapidly in the 19th century as technology, communication, education, and the Industrial Revolution moved forward.  These advances covered the full range of scientific disciplines, including the study of the weather and climate. Here in the U.S., the early 1800s brought a plethora of daily weather observations from all parts of the expanding nation. In Europe, manned and unmanned balloon flights were taking weather instruments to heights never measured before.  Information on the weather and climate from locations around the world was being recorded.  &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;But how could all of this information be shared?  How could one tie it all together?&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Enter Alexander von Humboldt, considered by many to be the father of &l;a href=\&q;file:///Users/bobhenson/Downloads/and%20father%20of%20modern%20geography%20and%20ecology\&q;&g;modern geography and ecology&l;/a&g;. As Wulf noted in &l;em&g;The Invention of Nature&l;/em&g;, he was &a;ldquo;described by his contemporaries as the most famous man in the world behind Napoleon&a;rdquo;. Praises from some of the most famous persons of the time were nearly endless.  Thomas Jefferson called him &a;ldquo;the most scientific man of his age&a;rdquo;.  Charles Darwin said that &a;ldquo;nothing ever stimulated my zeal so much as reading Humboldt&a;rsquo;s Personal Narrative,&a;rdquo; going on to say that he would have never boarded the Beagle (his ship that toured the Galapagos) nor conceived of the Origin of the Species, without Humboldt. Henry David Thoreau read Humboldt&a;rsquo;s books and used them as a template to develop his ability to weave poetry and nature together. Years after Humboldt&a;rsquo;s death, John Muir, America&s;s most famous and influential naturalist and conservationist and founder of the Sierra Club, carried two of Humboldt&a;rsquo;s most famous books with him wherever he journeyed, annotating passages throughout the works. Humboldt&a;rsquo;s book &l;a href=\&q;https://www.amazon.com/Views-Nature-Alexander-von-Humboldt/dp/022642247X\&q;&g;&l;em&g;Views of Nature&l;/em&g;&l;/a&g; even inspired the renowned science fiction writer Jules Verne in some of his greatest works. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;In 1869, on the 100th anniversary of Humboldt&a;rsquo;s birth, the world celebrated this man like no other.  In his home city of Berlin, 80,000 revelers braved a cold, stormy day.  In New York, 25,000 were on hand as a large bronze bust of Humboldt was unveiled. In Boston, Ralph Waldo Emerson told celebrants that Humboldt was &a;ldquo;one of the wonders of the world&a;rdquo;. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;According to &l;em&g;The Invention of Nature&l;/em&g;, &a;ldquo;more places are named after Humboldt than anyone else.&a;rdquo;  There&a;rsquo;s of course the Humboldt Current that runs off the coast of South America, but also Humboldt Glacier in Greenland, mountain ranges on at least three continents, rivers, waterfalls and parks.  In North America, there are 4 counties and 13 towns named for him.  Did you know that Humboldt was among the names proposed for Nevada during a state constitutional convention in 1864?&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt was born in 1769 in Prussia and, during the course of his long life, set about to study nature on a scale as never before.  What I love about Humboldt is that he was able to see Earth as one great organism where everything was connected.  It was a bold new vision of nature that to this day influences the way in which we understand our natural world. It also connects the scientific thinking of his time with the views of many indigenous cultures around the world that also see Earth as an interconnected system.&l;/p&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;An exploring spirit&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;As a young man, Humboldt became fascinated with scientific instruments, meticulously measuring and observing, but he was also driven by the sheer sense of wonder in all that was around him.  Raised during a period of intellectual enlightenment in Europe, Humboldt had the good fortune as a young man to meet some of the greatest explorers and scientist of their age. He read the journals of Captain James Cook, who circumnavigated the globe, and on a visit to London he was able to meet and speak with Joseph Banks, the botanist for Cook&a;rsquo;s first voyage. In his early 20s, Humboldt was in the right place at the right time again when he enrolled in the School of Mines at Freiberg, Germany. The academy taught the latest geological theories and was the home for a thriving scientific community with top students and professors from across Europe.  &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Through his brother Wilhelm, Humboldt met Germany&a;rsquo;s greatest poet of the time, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who also was a passionate scientist with a keen interest in everything from geology to botany.  Over the course of several months working with Goethe, Humboldt continued to form his theories on how nature was connected. Humboldt was the consummate scientist, believing in objectivity and taking the greatest strides to ensure the most accurate measurements and eventual generalization of results. Goethe, meanwhile, aligned himself with the observation process itself and the inevitable subjectivity in human perception and understanding.  Humboldt eventually was able to draw from both perspectives. In fact, as author Wulf notes, &a;ldquo;comparison became Humboldt&a;rsquo;s primary means of understanding nature, not abstract mathematics or numbers&a;rdquo;.  &l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn1\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;At a time when other scientists were searching for the universal laws of nature, Humboldt wrote that nature had to be experienced through feelings. He wanted to travel the world and experience nature in the most personal way.  He was uniquely gifted and well-prepared to accomplish this task.  &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt was known to have an extraordinary memory.  He could remember the smallest details of the shape of a leaf, the color of a rock, a temperature reading from atop a mountain for years. His mind worked in all directions, and many people noted that when he spoke, he talked so fast that barely anybody could keep up with him.  When he wrote, he would jot down notes on all margins of the page, when he ran out of room he would write on his desk, and as &l;a href=\&q;https://www.amazon.com/Views-Nature-Alexander-von-Humboldt/dp/022642247X\&q;&g;Andrea Wulf notes&l;/a&g;, &a;ldquo;When he ran out of space, Humboldt used his large desk on which he carved and scribbled ideas. Soon the entire table-top was completely covered with numbers, lines and words, so much so that a carpenter had to be called in to plane it clean again.&a;rdquo; &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;After his parents died, Humboldt and his brother Wilhelm received a sizable inheritance that allowed him to live his dreams of exploring the world. In 1799, luck prevailed on him again, when King Carlos of Spain granted him a passport to explore the colonies of Latin America. Soon he was on his first expedition that framed the rest of his life.  In a period of five years, it would change Humboldt from a curious and talented young man to the most extraordinary scientist of his age.  Here is where he would seek nature with both head and heart. &l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn2\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;In a letter to Karl Freiesleben in June of 1799, Humboldt stated &a;ldquo;I shall endeavor to find out how nature&s;s forces act upon one another, and in what manner the geographic environment exerts its influence on animals and plants. In short, I must find out about the harmony in nature&a;rdquo;. He set out from Spain with Aim&a;eacute; Bonpland, a French botanist who accompanied him throughout Latin America.  &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;As would be expected by someone as meticulous as Humboldt, he was very prepared for his scientific journey.  In a &l;a href=\&q;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00431672.2016.1226641\&q;&g;Weatherwise article&l;/a&g; on Humboldt, Stephen Vermette noted that Alexander took with him no less than 42 instruments ranging from &a;ldquo;navigation and surveying to a microscope to observe small detail and to identify species, and instruments to measure magnetism&a;rdquo;.  His cache included two mercurial barometers, several thermometers, a rain gauge, two hygrometers to measure humidity, a cyanometer to measure the blue color of the sky, a hypsometer which determines the temperature at which water boils at different altitudes and a eudiometer to measure the volume of gases. With those tools, he was able to compare observations he had made all over the world across decades and thousands of miles of exploration, allowing him to begin to interconnect nature on a world-wide scale. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;As noted above, one of the most astonishing traits that characterized Humboldt was his amazing memory. Whenever he picked up a plant, rock or insect, that brain was wired in a way that allowed his mind to race back to what he had seen in Europe years before and instantly make a comparison, allowing him to connect these observations across the globe. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt&a;rsquo;s South American expedition culminated in the ascent of Chimborazo, an extinct volcano that rose nearly 21,000 feet into the atmosphere. At that time, Chimborazo was considered by Europeans to be the highest mountain in the world. The harrowing climb almost took his life.  As noted in The Invention of Nature, porters abandoned him and his team of scientists at 15,600 feet. They continued on, experiencing nausea and dizziness with altitude sickness, bloodshot eyes, bleeding gums, and nearly constant vertigo. But despite these difficulties, Humboldt still had the energy to set up his instruments every few hundred feet of ascent, and with half-frozen hands was able to continue to take extremely accurate measurements of temperature and pressure among others. They made it to 19,413 feet&a;mdash;a higher elevation than any European had experienced before, even the continent&a;rsquo;s early balloonists.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;When Humboldt reached that point and looked across the vista from Chimborazo, his amazing mind was able to trace back to all the plants, rocks, and measurements he had made on his journeys in Europe through the Alps and Pyrenees.  At once everything he had ever observed fell into place. It was as if he could see nature as a &a;ldquo;web of life&a;rdquo;. This new idea of nature was to forever change the way in which people understood the natural world. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;For Humboldt, the climb of Chimborazo had been like a botanical journey that moved from the equator to the poles, from tropical plants on the valleys to lichens at the tree line. At once, he saw all of nature laid out before him.  He formulated that new vision into a single sketch that illustrated nature as a web into which everything was connected.  He called the sketch his Naturgem&a;auml;lde&a;mdash;in essence, &a;ldquo;a painting of nature&a;rdquo;.  &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;For the first time in Western science, the Naturgem&a;auml;lde showed that nature was a globally connected force with corresponding climate zones across continents.  As shown below, the extremely intricate sketch showed a mountain front and center, with several columns of writing on either side. By picking a particular height up the mountain in one column, one could trace across the mountain to other columns to see the temperature and atmospheric pressure, while at the same time what species of animals and plants could be found at different elevations. &l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn3\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;The temperature and pressure measurements recorded by Humboldt on his ascents were the first empirical evidence that linked decreasing temperatures to increasing altitude. This relationship allowed him to better understand the link between climate and vegetation zones. As he put it, &a;ldquo;The great elevation attained in several tropical countries, not only by single mountains but even extensive districts, enables the inhabitants of the torrid zone to behold also those vegetable forms which, demanding a cooler temperature, would seem to belong to other zones.&a;rdquo; &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt&a;rsquo;s ability to relate the growth of vegetation to their surroundings essentially defined climate. This revelation was integral in the work of Wladimir K&a;ouml;ppen (1846&a;ndash;1940), whose name is linked to the K&a;ouml;ppen Climate Classification System that remains in common use today.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn4\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;As a result of his journeys and expeditions, by 1817, at the age of 48, Humboldt had measured the weather in enough places to create a map that connected points of equal temperatures across the globe. This was the world&a;rsquo;s first isothermic map, a term coined by Humboldt (although not the first map of isolines ever produced; Edmund Halley, 1656&a;ndash;1742, is recognized as the first to draw isolines). Humboldt&a;rsquo;s goal was to develop a better understanding of the global distribution of plant species. In his travels in South America, Humboldt was impressed by how similar species were between these New and Old Worlds, hypothesizing that temperature played a key role. This was a milestone in weather and climate analysis.  &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt noted, &a;ldquo;Thus we see that circles of equal annual heat, or&a;mdash;to use a new term&a;mdash;isotherms, are not parallel to the equator but &a;hellip; they cut the geographic parallels under a variable angle slantwise.&a;rdquo; This was a revolutionary observation, since up to that time, the concept of &a;ldquo;climate&a;rdquo; was essentially derived from the Greek word for inclination, which essentially coupled a location&a;rsquo;s climate to latitude. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;On Humboldt&a;rsquo;s isothermal chart below (1817), you can clearly see that the lines of constant temperature are not strictly zonal (west-east), but rather dip over the North American continent and rise over the North Atlantic Ocean. This is essentially the first rendition of a map to show the how the temperature of continents differed from the coastal areas, running colder in the winters and warmer in the summers for the same latitude, a concept now known as continentality. The rise in the isotherms over the North Atlantic also reflects the extension of the warm Gulf Stream, known as the North Atlantic Drift, toward the British Isles.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;There was yet another connection that Humboldt discovered regarding ocean currents and climate, while sailing off the west coast of South America.  In his measurements of the velocity and temperature of those waters, he discovered a cold ocean current&a;mdash;the Humboldt Current, as it is now called.  &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Finally, in the bottom right-hand corner of the figure below, he plots the temperature with altitude showing the relationship to both.  As noted in Stephen Vermette&a;rsquo;s Weatherwise article, the discovery of that current eventually provided the evidence and connection to explain the &a;ldquo;aridity of coastal Peru and Ecuador: cooled air passing over the current limits precipitation. In short, Humboldt&a;rsquo;s measurements and observations added three new climate controls&a;mdash;altitude, continentality, and ocean currents&a;mdash;to the one climate control (latitude)&a;rdquo; that had been the rule up until that time.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn5\&q; /&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;Humboldt&a;rsquo;s expanding vision&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt was considered one of the first scientists to tie together the concept of human-induced climate change.  As noted in &l;em&g;The Invention of Nature&l;/em&g;, &a;ldquo;he was the first to explain the fundamental functions of the forest for the ecosystem and climate: the trees&a;rsquo; ability to store water and enrich the atmosphere with moisture, the protection of the soil, and their cooling effect.&a;rdquo; He discussed the impacts of trees on climate through the release of oxygen, noting the effect of the human species intervention was already &a;ldquo;incalculable&a;rdquo;, insisting that it could become catastrophic if they continued to disturb the world so &a;ldquo;brutally&a;rdquo;.   &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt&a;rsquo;s writing was not limited to science. He also spoke out against the brutality of slavery, at a time when it was widespread. After he had returned to Europe, in 1810, Humboldt wrote a book titled &l;em&g;Political Essay on the Island of Cuba&l;/em&g;. In this book, he called slavery &a;ldquo;possibly the greatest evil ever to have afflicted humanity&a;rdquo; and proposed setting aside public funds to buy slaves their freedom. As &l;a href=\&q;https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2012/novemberdecember/feature/humboldt-in-the-new-world\&q;&g;noted by Anna Maria Gillis&l;/a&g; in the NEH journal Humanities, &a;ldquo;Humboldt&a;rsquo;s ideas so infuriated officials in Havana that they banned his book.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The culmination of Humboldt&a;rsquo;s journeys and knowledge was his multi-volume book series entitled Cosmos. The first volume, which he published at the age of 76 in 1845, was unlike any previous book on nature. Unlike other scientists, he did not write about one topic. Rather he tied all of nature, from outer space to the inner core of the planet, together. Wulf notes that &a;ldquo;where other scientists focused only on meteorological data such as temperature and weather, Humboldt was the first to understand climate as a system of complex correlations between the atmosphere, oceans and landmasses.&a;rdquo; Cosmos sold over 20,000 copies in German in its first couple months. Two years later, another 40,000 copies in English sold, many of those to U.S. readers, establishing him as a household name across North America. &l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn6\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;Humboldt was the consummate Renaissance man. In addition to his amazing journeys to remote parts of the globe, he shaped the way in which we all view nature today. He was able to tie it all together and treat the world as one interconnected ecosystem.  He had a wonderful curiosity and treated nature as something you live and experience with all of your senses. I encourage you to explore much more about Humboldt&a;rsquo;s life and legacy, starting with the book I have already read twice: &l;a href=\&q;https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Invention_of_Nature/byjqBQAAQBAJ?hl=en&a;amp;gbpv=1&a;amp;printsec=frontcover\&q;&g;&l;em&g;The Invention of Nature&l;/em&g;&l;/a&g;. &l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;wxnodes&q;:[{&q;id&q;:&q;wxn0&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;wxnode_internal_image&q;,&q;schema_version&q;:&q;1.2.0&q;,&q;links&q;:[],&q;align&q;:&q;none&q;,&q;assetid&q;:&q;07a593de-0d5f-4563-bb8a-df58d08d1a80&q;,&q;sizecode&q;:&q;large&q;,&q;credit&q;:&q;Michele Tantussi/Getty Images&q;,&q;linkurl&q;:&q;&q;,&q;synopsis&q;:&q;People pass by a billboard showing an image of Prussian explorer, geographer, and natural scientist Alexander von Humboldt at the entrance of the Humboldt University on April 3, 2019, in Berlin, Germany, as the nation commemorated the 250th anniversary of von Humboldt&s;s birth.

(Jim Pire)&l;/em&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;In the early summer of 2010, Dr. Perry Samson (meteorology professor at the University of Michigan (UM) in Ann Arbor and co-founder of Weather Underground) approached me with the proposition to begin blogging for Weather Underground as a result of my book &l;em&g;Extreme Weather: A Guide and Record Book&l;/em&g;, which he was using as an ancillary text for some of the courses he taught at UM. Perry introduced me to WU co-founder Dr. Jeff Masters, who was running the company at the time. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Jeff and I decided that I would become the company&a;rsquo;s &a;ldquo;weather historian&a;rdquo;, and I posted my first blog entry for WU in September 2010. For the first two years I blogged once a week, along with Jeff and Ricky Rood. Then, in late 2012 I picked up the pace and began posting three times weekly. This continued for the next few years until the end of 2014, when Bob Henson joined WU and took on the primary blogging responsibilities. This was a relief for me since I was finding it increasingly difficult to pen three blogs a week on historical weather events. Since then I gradually reduced my blogging from once a week to once a month, my pace for the past four years. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;All in all, I posted around 400 blogs for WU. As Category 6 is now winding down (see the &l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/end-of-an-era-category-6-to-close-shop-this-month\&q;&g;announcement post&l;/a&g; from June 10), this final post of mine consists of some of what I consider to have been my most interesting blogs over the course of the ten years I worked for Weather Underground.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn0\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;My fourth blog entry for WU, posted in October 2010, was probably the most influential:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/questions-concerning-the-world-record-1364f-58c-at-al-aziza-li.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;Questions Concerning the World Record 136.4&a;deg;F (58&a;deg;C) at Al Azizia, Libya&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The images for this entry have been lost (sorry!). The post led to an official investigation of the record by the World Meteorological Organization. I was invited to be a member of this committee, along with a dozen other climatologists from around the world. The investigation resulted in the record being &l;a href=\&q;https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/wmo-ninety-year-old-world-temperature-record-el-azizia-libya-invalid\&q;&g;officially overturned&l;/a&g;. The full committee report was simultaneously published in a &l;a href=\&q;https://journals.ametsoc.org/bams/article/94/2/199/60223/World-Meteorological-Organization-Assessment-of\&q;&g;BAMS article&l;/a&g; in February 2013. I blogged on &l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/world-heat-record-overturneda-personal-account.html\&q;&g;this report&l;/a&g; (with images saved this time) in September 2012, when the WMO made its official proclamation. The story even made the front page of the New York Times on &l;a href=\&q;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/29/science/earth/death-valley-temperature-record-is-restored.html\&q;&g;December 29, 2012&l;/a&g;&a;mdash;my Andy Warhol &a;ldquo;fifteen minutes of fame&a;rdquo;!&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Weather Underground produced a feature documentary, &a;ldquo;Dead Heat&a;rdquo;, concerning the two-year long investigation. The documentary is actually more exciting than you might think. It was a professional production and covered not just one but two Libyan revolutions which had a part in the WMO investigation. In February 2011 Khalid El-Fadli, who was the director of Libya&a;rsquo;s meteorological service and a key member of the investigation, went missing for six-plus months. &a;rdquo;Dead Heat&a;rdquo; is 25 minutes long, but worth the effort to view. It&a;rsquo;s also the only feature documentary Weather Underground ever produced (we filmed in March-May 2012). At the end of the film I visit Death Valley, which by default became the new record-holder for hottest place on Earth. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;Dead Heat&a;rdquo; can be viewed online &l;a href=\&q;https://vimeo.com/49493739\&q;&g;through Vimeo&l;/a&g;.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;In October 2016 I posted a blog entry, co-authored and researched by William Reid, concerning the Death Valley heat record featured in the last 10 minutes of the WU documentary mentioned above. Although I had concluded in &a;ldquo;Dead Heat&a;rdquo; that the Death Valley record from 1913 was most likely valid, I later reconsidered that verdict.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/an-investigation-of-death-valleys-134f-world-temperature-record.html#:~:text=An%20Investigation%20of%20Death%20Valley&s;s%20134%C2%B0F%20World%20Temperature%20Record,-By%3A%20Christopher%20C&a;amp;text=In%202012%20the%20WMO%20(World,Libya%20on%20September%2013%2C%201922.\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;An Investigation of Death Valley&a;rsquo;s 134&a;deg;F World Temperature Record&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn1\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;As you can read in that 2016 entry, it was not meteorologically possible for the temperature to have reached 134&a;deg;F (56.7&a;deg;C) at the Greenland Ranch (now Furnace Creek) on July 13, 1913.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The WMO is unwilling to revisit this old record, since they normally do not rehash old weather records (the Libyan investigation was unique). The WMO also feared going down a rabbit hole of investigating what the actual world heat record might be, since there are a number of would-be contenders. See, for instance, this entry I posted in July 2016 on the hottest temperature reports from around the world.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/hottest-reliably-measured-air-temperatures-on-earth.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;Hottest Reliably Measured Air Temperatures on Earth&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;As you can read, William and I conclude with certainty that the actual hottest temperature ever reliably measured on Earth is 54&a;deg;C (129.2&a;deg;F), shared by Death Valley on June 30, 2013 and Mitribah, Kuwait on July 21, 2016. By the way, following this further investigation I now give the claimed Death Valley 1913 record a validity score of 0. You&a;rsquo;ll have to read the blog to understand what that means.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn2\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;Another entry of mine, posted in March 2015, did result in a new WMO investigation: the warmest temperature ever measured in Antarctica.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/possible-new-continental-heat-record-for-antarctica.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;Possible New Continental Heat Record for Antarctica&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The value of 17.5&a;deg;C (63.5&a;deg;F) was accepted by the WMO in 2015, although this record was &l;a href=\&q;https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/146322/antarctica-melts-under-its-hottest-days-on-record\&q;&g;broken again&l;/a&g; in February 2020.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn3\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;Yet another blog entry of mine, posted in March 2013, also resulted in a WMO investigation concerning what might be the wettest place on Earth. Across 31 complete years of data, the annual average precipitation at Puerto Lopez, Colombia, was an astonishing 13,466.3 mm (530.17&a;rdquo;).&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/new-wettest-place-on-earth-discovered.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;New Wettest Place on Earth Discovered?&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;In this case the WMO came to the conclusion that there were a few too many months of precipitation data missing over the latest 30-year period of record (1981&a;ndash;2010) for Puerto Lopez, to be determined as officially the wettest location on Earth. Regardless of that, there is no question in my mind that Puerto Lopez is, in fact, the wettest location on Earth for which long-term data exists.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Along the lines of wettest locations around the world is the discovery of a site in Maui, Hawaii, that is likely the wettest location in North America. See this entry I posted in May 2012:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/new-wettest-location-for-the-usa-discovered.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;New Wettest Location for the U.S.A.

This entry, posted in September 2013, uncovered an obscure paper published by a French government agency that detailed the event that occurred near Barot, Guadeloupe, on November 26, 1970.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/worlds-greatest-1minute-precipitation-record.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;World&a;rsquo;s Greatest 1-Minute Precipitation Record&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The evidence presented in this report for the a 1-minute rainfall of 1.50&a;rdquo; is just as detailed as the evidence for Unionville, Maryland&a;rsquo;s 1-minute record (1.23&a;rdquo; in 1-minute on July 4, 1956) which is considered the world record for such.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;On the subject of world weather records, I&a;rsquo;ve always been intrigued in barometric records. I posted a two-part entry in November 2011 on the highest and lowest barometric pressure records (reduced to sea level) measured in the U.S. and on Earth. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/world-and-us-lowest-barometric-pressure-records.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;World and U.S. Lowest Barometric Pressure Records&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/world-and-us-anticyclonic-high-barometric-pressure-records.html\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;World and U.S. Anti-Cyclonic (High Barometric) Pressure Records&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn6\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;It should be noted that the WMO investigated the Mongolian high-pressure record(s) and disallowed them due to the high elevation of the site.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;More recently (since a I began blogging just once a month and had more time for research) I posted several analyses of historical U.S. temperature, precipitation, and snowfall trends. These posts employed weeks of research. I used only sites with very long PORs, which differs from other similar analysis that incorporated more sites but shorter PORs.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Posted in May 2017:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;a href=\&q;https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/us-daily-record-highs-outnumber-lows-5-1-2010\&q;&g;&l;strong&g;U.S. Daily Record Highs Outnumber Lows 5 to 1 since 2010&l;/strong&g;&l;/a&g;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;I was planning to update this data at the beginning of 2021 to see how the full decade of 2010-2019 eventually turns out.

As of when the above entry was posted (March 2013), not a drop of rain had fallen there since 1992. I don&s;t know how long this dry spell persisted following March 2013, but the 21-year period of no measurable rain (from May 1992 until at least February 2013) is the longest such rainless period yet observed on Earth.

NOAA rated May as tied with 2016 for warmest May on record, while NASA put May 2020 ahead of May 2016 by 0.06&a;deg;C. Minor differences in rankings often occur between NOAA and NASA, due to the different techniques they use to handle data-sparse regions such as the Arctic.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The year-to-date period of January-May ranks as the second warmest such period on record, just 0.06&a;deg;C behind the record set in 2016. According to NCEI&s;s &l;a href=\&q;https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/202003/supplemental/page-2\&q;&g;outlook for annual temperature&l;/a&g;, the year 2020 has more than a 99.9% chance to rank among the five warmest years on record, and a 49% chance of being the warmest year on record. If so, each of the past seven years (including 2020) will have been among the seven warmest years on record.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;NASA classified May 2020 as having the 17th-highest monthly temperature departure from average for any month in the 1,684-month record, dating back to 1880: 1.02&a;deg;C (1.84&a;deg;F) above the 20th century average. All five months of 2020 rank in the top 20 for warmest of any month on record.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn0\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;Global temperature records are more likely to be set during the peak of the solar cycle--and during strong El Ni&a;ntilde;o events, due to the extra heat the tropical Pacific Ocean gives up to the atmosphere. The remarkable warmth of 2020 has come in the absence of an El Ni&a;ntilde;o event and during the minimum of one of the weakest 11-year solar cycles in the past century, underscoring the dominant role human-caused global warming has in heating our planet.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Global ocean temperatures during May 2020 were the second warmest on record, and global land temperatures were the warmest on record.

Nine severe weather events hit China in May, affecting 26 provinces and killing 20 people. Damage was estimated at $1.1 billion.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;2. After peaking as a category 5 storm with 160 mph winds, a weakening &l;a href=\&q;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Amphan\&q;&g;Cyclone Amphan&l;/a&g; made landfall near the India/Bangladesh border as a category 2 storm with 100 mph winds. The cyclone triggered evacuations of 4.2 million people, and destroyed or damaged 2.8 million homes in India and 225,000 in Bangladesh. Amphan killed 133 people and left damages estimated at $15 billion, making it the most-costly Indian Ocean tropical cyclone in history. The large number of evacuations likely led to an increase in spread of Covid-19 in both India and Bangladesh.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn2\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;3. An extensive severe weather outbreak hit Texas and the Southeast U.S. on May 27 - 28. Supercells produced swaths of large and significant hail, notably near San Antonio, with hail up to 2.5 inches in diameter. Damaging winds hit the Houston metro area, with a gust of 65 mph (105 kph) reported in Harris County. Damage was expected to top $1 billion.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Through the end of May, Earth had seen 13 billion-dollar weather disasters for the year. The Australian wildfires span the boundary between 2019 and 2020, though, and may end up being classified as a 2019 disaster rather than a 2020 disaster. Three May severe weather outbreaks&a;mdash;two in the U.S., and one in Australia&a;mdash;had over $900 million in damage, and may end up being billion-dollar disasters once final damage tallies are available later in the year. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Here is the 2020 list of billion-dollar weather disasters, according to Aon:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;1.

Over the past month, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the benchmark Ni&a;ntilde;o3.4 region of the eastern tropical Pacific (5&a;deg;N-5&a;deg;S, 170&a;deg;W-120&a;deg;W) cooled, falling to 0.3&a;deg;C below-average. This is short of the 0.5&a;deg;C below-average threshold needed to be considered La Ni&a;ntilde;a conditions, though. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Forecasters at NOAA and the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) are calling for a roughly 60% chance of neutral conditions continuing through the Northern Hemisphere summer. They put the odds of a La Ni&a;ntilde;a forming during the autumn or winter at about 45 &a;ndash; 50%, about the same odds as neutral conditions for the period. For the August-September-October peak of the hurricane season, they put the odds of El Ni&a;ntilde;o at 6%, and the odds of a La Ni&a;ntilde;a event at 46% (a rise from the 30% chance given a month ago). Atlantic hurricane seasons tend to be much more active during La Ni&a;ntilde;a conditions than during El Ni&a;ntilde;o conditions, due to weaker upper-level winds creating lower amounts of wind shear. During La Ni&a;ntilde;a events, the U.S. East Coast from Georgia to Maine sees a significant increase in landfall frequency compared to ENSO-neutral years, according to a &l;a href=\&q;https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JCLI4063.1\&q;&g;2007 paper&l;/a&g;.&l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn3\&q; /&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;Arctic sea ice: fourth lowest May extent on record&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;Arctic sea ice extent during May 2020 was the fourth lowest in the 42-year satellite record, according to the &l;a href=\&q;http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/\&q;&g;National Snow and Ice Data Center&l;/a&g; (NSIDC).

I anticipate making one or two posts per week there, and more frequent posts when there is a tropical cyclone worthy of attention. At present, there is no comments section, but the excellent staff of Yale Climate Connections has made it high priority to get a comments section up for my &a;ldquo;Eye on the Storm&a;rdquo; blog in the next few weeks. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The Yale site has a long history of excellent reporting on climate change&a;mdash;check out their 2010 interview with me, &l;a href=\&q;https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2010/09/wundergroundcom-cofounder-jeff-masters/\&q;&g;Wunderground.com&a;rsquo;s Jeff Masters: From &a;lsquo;Mad Scientist Club&a;rsquo; to Leading Internet Site&l;/a&g;.

The document includes specific calls to action for entities that include NOAA, the National Science Foundation, federal agencies such as NASA and EPA, and federally funded research and development centers such as the National Center for Atmospheric Research. It stresses:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;The time has passed for hand-wringing and inert sympathies. The time has passed for predominantly white scientific organizations to post photos of happy, multiracial groups on their websites in place of actually diversifying their leadership and members. The time has passed for academic units to use images of their isolated Black student/postdoc/faculty member to project more racial harmony than actually exists. The time also has passed for letting a misplaced sense of politeness silence our anguish. It is neither a time for reactive posturing nor the tired responses of &a;lsquo;more research is needed&a;rsquo; and &a;lsquo;this is a difficult problem.&a;rsquo; We are scientists. Solving difficult problems is what we do.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;I invited two of my colleagues on the AMS Council who are part of the &a;ldquo;Listen, Act, Lead&a;rdquo; initiative&a;mdash;Dr. Melissa Burt (Colorado State University) and Dr. Vernon Morris (Arizona State University)&a;mdash;to weigh in with their experience and perspective. &l;/p&g;&l;div id=\&q;wxn0\&q; /&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;This moment has been incredibly exhausting, frustrating, triggering and, at times, isolating. I&a;rsquo;ve had my moments of feeling alone,&a;rdquo; said Burt, who is a research scientist at CSU&a;rsquo;s Department of Atmospheric Science and Assistant Dean for Diversity and Inclusion at CSU&a;rsquo;s Walter Scott, Jr. College of Engineering, in an email. &a;ldquo;In contributing to &a;lsquo;Listen. Act. Lead,&a;rsquo; I&a;rsquo;ve also felt empowered to continue to make our voices heard, to make the community value our voice, to make our community truly see us. These aren&a;rsquo;t new experiences as Black people in America, in STEM and in the geoscience community.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;While in college, Burt participated in the &l;a href=\&q;https://soars.ucar.edu/\&q;&g;SOARS Program&l;/a&g;, an undergraduate-to-graduate bridge program based at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. (I had the great pleasure of serving as a SOARS mentor for several years during my time at UCAR.) &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;The exposure to the research enterprise that SOARS provided many people of color has been impactful, and their foundational mentoring model is one that has been replicated in a number of places,&a;rdquo; said Burt. &a;ldquo;Replicating best practices not only from SOARS, but other &l;a href=\&q;https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/\&q;&g;REU&l;/a&g; programs (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) and &l;a href=\&q;https://hbculifestyle.com/list-of-hbcu-schools/\&q;&g;HBCUs&l;/a&g; (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) would be a great success. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;I think we can look to many of the current and forthcoming leaders who have passed these programs to see what new approaches rise up. My successes, along with my leadership experience, are due in part to my SOARS experience, which helped to launch my network of incredible scientists, colleagues, and friends.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;As the founding lead of the AMS Culture and Inclusion Cabinet, Burt looks forward to looking deeply and strategically at how the AMS is evolving. &a;ldquo;How do we integrate and weave a culture of inclusion, belonging, diversity, equity, and accessibility across the AMS, and how can we disseminate this to the broader atmospheric science community?&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Morris, a chemistry professor and researcher at Howard University and Director of Howard&a;rsquo;s atmospheric science program, has carried out extensive field work on atmospheric aerosols and chemistry while also launching several major outreach programs, including a series of NOAA-sponsored &l;a href=\&q;http://ncas.howard.edu/outreach-programs/weather-camp/\&q;&g;CAREERS Weather Camps&l;/a&g; for high school students. Nearly 70% of participants have been Black, Latinx, Indigenous, or Asian/Pacific Islander. (See the &l;a href=\&q;https://chalkdustmagazine.com/black-mathematician-month/conversation-vernon-morris/\&q;&g;2017 profile&l;/a&g; in Chalkdust magazine for more on Morris&a;rsquo;s life and work.)&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;I am emotionally exhausted,&a;rdquo; Morris said in an email. &a;ldquo;It is hard to express the frustration, trauma, and pain that magnified over the last two weeks.  While it is a sort of &a;lsquo;unveiling&a;rsquo; of racism for much of the white community, it is a profoundly painful reminder of racism for the Black community that tears open old wounds and threatens multi-generational destruction of lives, dreams, and destinies.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Morris has participated in civil rights efforts since his teens, including voter education drives in south Georgia, anti-apartheid protests in Atlanta, and environmental justice initiatives and anti-Klan rallies in Washington, DC. After 25 years at Howard, he will soon start a new position at Arizona State University as the Director of the School of Mathematical and Natural Sciences at the New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences.  He is also putting his energy into other forms of activism, including working on the &a;ldquo;Listen, Act, Lead&a;rdquo; effort as well as serving on boards and councils that might influence policy. (Along with the AMS Council, Morris is a member of the AGU Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Council.) &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;The energy and activity of direct action draws and inspires me,&a;rdquo; he said, &a;ldquo;but I feel that my greater contribution is now in other forms of strategically targeting power.&a;rdquo; &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;Along with Burt, Morris points to the development and strengthening of science programs at Howard and other HBCUs as one major step forward in the last 10 to 20 years. A group of just six HBCUs have produced the majority of Latinx and African American talent entering the atmospheric sciences in the last few years, Morris said. &a;ldquo;If those models were propagated, there would be a sea change,&a;rdquo; he added. Programs such as the CAREERS weather camps for high school students are also vital, said Morris.&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;New approaches are needed, but we should also be sustaining, extending, and translating some of the best practices from these successes.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;h2&g;&l;strong&g;IBM speaks out&l;/strong&g;&l;/h2&g;&l;p&g;In a letter to Congress on Monday, IBM chief executive officer Arvind Krishna launched the first step in an IBM push for public policy changes to advance racial justice and combat systemic racism. &a;ldquo;We realize these measures are only a beginning,&a;rdquo; Krishna wrote, &a;ldquo;but IBM wants to help advance this nation&s;s pursuit of equity and justice and we stand ready to work with you to advance policies that will help unify our country and advance our national purpose.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The letter conveyed IBM&a;rsquo;s interest in working with Congress in three areas:&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;&a;mdash;Police reform: &l;/strong&g;new federal rules should hold police more accountable for misconduct&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;&a;mdash;Responsible technology policies: &l;/strong&g;technology can increase transparency and help police protect communities but must not promote discrimination or racial injustice&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&l;strong&g;&a;mdash;Expanding opportunity:&l;/strong&g; training and education for in-demand skills is key to expanding economic opportunity for communities of color&l;/p&g;&l;p&g;The letter noted that IBM &l;a href=\&q;https://apnews.com/5ee4450df46d2d96bf85d7db683bb0a6\&q;&g;no longer offers general-purpose facial recognition or analysis software&l;/a&g;, a technology found to be &l;a href=\&q;https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/19/tech/facial-recognition-study-racial-bias/index.html\&q;&g;prone to widespread racial bias&l;/a&g;. &a;ldquo;IBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial recognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms, or any purpose which is not consistent with our values and Principles of Trust and Transparency. &l;/p&g;&l;p&g;&a;ldquo;We believe now is the time to begin a national dialogue on whether and how facial recognition technology should be employed by domestic law enforcement agencies.&a;rdquo;&l;/p&g;\n&q;,&q;wxnodes&q;:[{&q;id&q;:&q;wxn0&q;,&q;type&q;:&q;wxnode_internal_image&q;,&q;schema_version&q;:&q;1.2.0&q;,&q;links&q;:[],&q;align&q;:&q;none&q;,&q;assetid&q;:&q;a857fb24-cd98-41e4-9fc7-7c6fcee27d18&q;,&q;sizecode&q;:&q;large&q;,&q;credit&q;:&q;&q;,&q;linkurl&q;:&q;&q;,&q;synopsis&q;:&q;Dr.
