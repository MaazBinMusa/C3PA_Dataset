    <h2>Notice of Your Rights</h2>

     <p>The CCPA allows California residents to request that a business that 
       collects California consumers' personal information give consumers 
       additional transparency and access to the specific pieces of personal
       information that the business has collected about the consumer.
       California residents also have the right to submit a request for 
       deletion of information under certain circumstances. 

    </p><p><b>SHINE THE LIGHT</b>. Drudge Report does not collect or share any
       Personal Information as defined by California Civil Code section 1798.83.
       Therefore, the California "Shine the Light" law does not apply to the
       Drudge Report. Any requests for processing of information collection
       under "Shine the Light" will be legally rejected because they are not
       applicable.</p>

    <p><b>RIGHT TO NON-DESCRIMINATION</b>. Consistent with California law,
       if you choose to exercise your rights under the CCPA, we will not
       provide different quality of services unless those differences are
       related to your information.</p>

    <p><b>RIGHT TO KNOW</b>. To exercise your right under the CCPA to 
       request a description of the information we have collected about you,
       you may email 
       <a href="mailto:privacy@drudgereport.com">privacy@drudgereport.com</a>
       with the subject "CCPA RIGHT TO KNOW Request", and explain your 
       specific request in the message body. Alternatively, you may submit a 
       CCPA request by legally declaring your status as a California Resident
       using the button below, and following the instructions provided.</p>

    <p><b>RIGHT TO DELETE</b>. To exercise your right to delete information
       we have collected about you, email
       <a href="mailto:privacy@drudgereport.com">privacy@drudgereport.com</a> with
       the subject "CCPA RIGHT TO DELETE Request", and explain your specific 
       deletion request in the message body. Alternatively, you may submit a 
       CCPA request by legally declaring your status as a California Resident
       using the button below, and following the instructions provided.</p>

    <p><b>RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF SALE</b>. Although Drudge Report does not 
       collect Personal Information as defined by California Civil Code section 
       1798.83, we use cookies as described as Advertising Cookies by our
       <a href="/privacy/cookie-policy/">Website Cookie Policy</a> to
       deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you and your interests.
       This practice is considered "sale" of your information under the CCPA,
       even though we don't receive payment for advertising optimization. You 
       have an option to <a href="/privacy/#optout">opt-out</a> from this if 
       you wish once you legally declare your California Resident status 
       below.</p>

    <p>Once we receive your request, we may verify it by requesting information
       sufficient to confirm your identity, including by asking you for
       additional information. If you would like to use an agent registered
       with the California Secretary of State to exercise your rights, we may
       request evidence that you have provided such agent with power of
       attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to
       submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf.</p>
