However, for automated processing that is significant and related to
sensitive Personal Data, prior to sharing or using such data, we will
first seek your consent. For the subset of automated processing included

encourage you to adjust the sharing settings to best meet your
objectives and sharing comfort level. In the interest of safeguarding
your Personal Data, we have outlined some initial default sharing
settings.</p>
<h3 id="default-sharing-settings">Default Sharing Settings</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>“Physical Stats,”</strong> <strong>“Diary”</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>“Community Social Data”</strong>
are set as&nbsp;<strong>Private.</strong>&nbsp;“Private” means not shared with friends or
other members. You can change this default status for some of your
physical stats. Information that is “Private” by default includes,
for example, your height, weight and BMI.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>“Activity”</strong>&nbsp;is set as&nbsp; <strong>Friends Only.</strong>&nbsp;“Friends Only” means
visible to your friends in their news feed, but not shared with
other members. You can change this default status if you want.
Information that is set as “Friends Only” by default includes, for
example, your friendships, news feed comments, completed food
diaries, and workouts completed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>“Forum Posts”</strong>&nbsp;are&nbsp;<strong>Public.</strong> “Public”&nbsp;means visible to all
others using the service.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Lookup Information</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(“Let my friends find me”</strong>

allows people to see that you are on MyFitnessPal and easily add you
as a friend (i.e., your account is discoverable by email address).
We believe that social motivation helps you achieve your goals
faster and allowing your friends to be able to find you is crucial
to this experience.&nbsp;<strong>“Profile”</strong>&nbsp;information and picture is visible
only to MyFitnessPal members who are logged in (age is Private on a
member’s profile by default). If you set your entire account as
Private, your lookup information will no longer be available for
your friends to find you (unless you otherwise indicate that desire
within the Services).</p>
</li>
</ul>

“public” IP addresses, such as the IP address for a home router that is
visible to the Internet, as well as “local” IP addresses, which are IP
addresses assigned to computers and mobile devices “behind” a router
(such as a home router). Our advertising and analytics partners may use
IP addresses to group or correlate devices for purposes of analytics,
security and anti-fraud purposes, interest-based advertising, ad
targeting, ad attribution, and limiting ad frequency.</p>
<p>You can choose not to have IP address used for purposes of advertising
or analytics by using the cookie controls for “Advertising Cookies,” and
“Performance/Analytics,” above.</p>
<h3 id="web-pixels-or-beacons-use">Web Pixels or Beacons Use</h3>
<p>Pixels are extremely small image files that, when loaded by your web
browser, cause the browser to make a network request to the party
corresponding to the pixel. If that party’s cookies are currently stored
in your browser, those cookies will be transmitted with the request.
Beacons can be used on web pages for advertising or to confirm the
opening of a marketing email. When used in conjunction with cookies for
interest-based-advertising, the cookie controls above can be used to
control the purpose for which they are used.</p>
<h3 id="html5-local-storage">HTML5 Local Storage</h3>
<p>HTML5 Local Storage in the browser is different from cookies, but can be
used for the same purpose (to pair a tracking ID to a particular web
server with your web browser so that the web server can identify your
web browser over time). You can control the purpose for which HTML5
Local Storage is used by using the cookie controls outlined above.</p>
<h3 id="social-network-interaction-and-widgets">Social Network Interaction and Widgets</h3>
<p>Social network widgets, buttons, and plug-ins on our Website passively
transmit data regarding a social network’s members to that social
network, even when a button is not clicked. These technologies may allow
a social network (e.g., Facebook) to personally identify its members and
to know the web pages its members have visited. This is true wherever
social network buttons are embedded, regardless of whether a button is
“clicked” or “pressed.” If you belong to a social network or use these
categories of web services, you should review the privacy policies of
those services to understand the nature of the data that they collect
and what, if any, options the service offers to control how data is
collected and used. If you disable advertising cookies, the passive
tracking associated with these buttons will be blocked on our sites.</p>
<h3 id="mobile-device-advertising-ids-location-sensor-data-and-in-range-device-data-use">Mobile Device Advertising IDs, Location, Sensor Data, and In-Range Device Data Use</h3>
<p>Our Services may transmit Device IDs, general location data, and data
from sensors to us and our partners, including our advertising partners.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Device IDs</em> include IDs associated with your mobile device carrier
such as IMEI, MEID, IMSI; platform-specific IDs such as Android ID,
Google AID, and Apple’s IDFA; and IDs that are part of your device
hardware, such as WiFi MAC address, and serial number. Exactly which
Device IDs are transmitted can depend on your mobile device platform
and the version of your operating system.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>General Location Data</em>. Our Services may transmit general location
data. General location data may be obtained from GPS services, cell
tower triangulation, or known location of nearby WiFi access points.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Sensor and In-Range Device Data</em>. Our apps and Services may also
collect Device IDs and network addresses (including IP addresses,
MAC addresses, and SSIDs) from other, in-range or networked devices
and WiFi Access Points.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>How We Use Mobile Device Data</em>. We may use Device IDs, coarse
location and general location data, and data from sensors, including
the local network, (together with app usage data and Fitness and
Wellness Data) for strictly necessary purposes; improving our apps
and analytics; personalization and preferences; and cross-app,
cross-device, interest-based advertising.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="withdraw-your-consent-for-use-of-your-mobile-device-ids-for-analytics-and-advertising">Withdraw Your Consent for Use of Your Mobile Device IDs for Analytics and Advertising</h3>
<p>Activating the “Limit Ad Tracking,” “Opt out of Ads Personalization,” or
equivalent setting from your mobile device will transmit a signal to us
and any third parties that we use. When that signal is received by
MyFitnessPal or third parties, it communicates your choice to not have
Device IDs used for purposes of advertising or analytics. We honor the
signal and require that our third party advertising and analytics
partners do the same.</p>
<p>To the extent our App personalizes functionality for you, you can change
these settings within the App, or reset to defaults by deleting and
reinstalling the App.</p>

<p><em>Residents of California</em></p>
<p>If you are a resident of California, you have certain rights to the
Personal Data that we have collected about you. Under California law,
the exercise of these rights is subject to certain exemptions to
safeguard the public interest (e.g., the prevention or detection of
crime) and our interests (e.g., maintaining confidentially when legally
required ). We will comply with your request as soon as reasonably
practicable. Requests to exercise your rights may be granted in whole,
in part, or not at all, depending on the scope and nature of the request
and applicable law. To prevent unauthorized access to your Personal
Data, we take steps to verify an individual’s right to the data -
including requiring users to reach out to us directly from a verified
email address, pass a challenge response, and/or confirm information
associated with the account. Following verification of your identity, we
will notify you if we are unable to fulfill your request and outline the
reasons we are unable to honor your request at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong></p>
<p>You have the following rights:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Right of Access to Your Personal Data:</strong>&nbsp;You have the right to ask
us for confirmation on whether we are processing your Personal Data,
and access to the Personal Data, as permitted by law. This may
include what Personal Data we collect, use, or disclose about you.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Right to Deletion:</strong>&nbsp;You have the right to ask us to delete your
Personal Data, as permitted by law.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Right to Opt-out of “Sale” and Certain Sharing Practices:</strong>&nbsp;You
have the right to opt-out of certain data sharing practices with
third parties who may use your Personal Data solely for their own
purposes. Your right to opt-out is limited to information we “sell”
to these third parties. “Sell” in this case does not mean providing
data in exchange for money – <em>we don’t do that.</em> “Sell” instead
means the disclosure of data, including technical device data that
does not identify you directly, when a third party might use that
data for its own purposes, such as for personalized advertising. We
do not have actual knowledge that we sell personal information of
minors under 16 years of age.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination:</strong>&nbsp;We will not discriminate against
you, in terms of price or services that we offer, if you submit one

<p><strong>Additional California Rights</strong></p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to
request and obtain from us a list of what Personal Data (if any) we
disclosed to third parties for that third party’s direct marketing
purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of
those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free
of charge.</p>
<p>Under Section 1798.83, we currently do not share any Personal Data with
third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If we do decide to
share your Personal Data with third parties for their marketing
purposes, you may opt-out of this disclosure at any time by submitting a
request to our&nbsp;<a class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiLink-root MuiLink-underlineAlways css-15kjgm" href="/contact-us">support team</a>,
or in writing to:</p>
<p>MyFitnessPal, Inc.<br>ATTN: Privacy/Legal<br>100 Congress Avenue, Suite 400<br>Austin, TX 78701</p>

You can change this default status if you want.\n  Information that is set as “Friends Only” by default includes, for\n  example, your friendships, news feed comments, completed food\n  diaries, and workouts completed.\n\n- **“Forum Posts”** are **Public.** “Public” means visible to all\n  others using the service.\n\n- **Lookup Information** **(“Let my friends find me”**\n  and **“Profile”**) are set as Public. **“Let my friends find me”**\n  allows people to see that you are on MyFitnessPal and easily add you\n  as a friend (i.e., your account is discoverable by email address).\n  We believe that social motivation helps you achieve your goals\n  faster and allowing your friends to be able to find you is crucial\n  to this experience. **“Profile”** information and picture is visible\n  only to MyFitnessPal members who are logged in (age is Private on a\n  member’s profile by default). If you set your entire account as\n  Private, your lookup information will no longer be available for\n  your friends to find you (unless you otherwise indicate that desire\n  within the Services).\n\n### Changing Your Sharing Preferences\n\nDetails on how to update your sharing preferences and the default\nsettings for our Services are outlined within the [sharing\nstandard](https://support.myfitnesspal.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032273872-How-do-I-make-my-diary-visible-to-other-users).\n\n**Note:** When you share information from our Services externally with a\nSNS, the information you post is governed by their privacy policy and\nsettings.\n\n## Interest-Based Advertising\n\nInterest-based advertising is advertising that is targeted to you based\non your web browsing and app usage over time and across websites or\napps. Our advertising practices also include the creation and use of\n“audience segments.” You have the option to restrict the use of\ninformation for interest-based advertising and to opt-out of receiving\ninterest-based ads. Depending on where you access our website from, you\nmay also be asked to consent to our use of cookies, including\nadvertising cookies. Additional information on Audience Segments and our\nchoices for interest- based advertising is found below.\n\n- **Audience Segments.** We disclose various types of information for\n  purposes of interest-based advertising, including for third party,\n  interest-based advertising. This processing includes the use of\n  Personal Data to create audience segments. These audience segments\n  are then made available for interest-based advertising, including\n  for third party advertising, on MyFitnessPal online properties. The\n  audience segments are based on website visits, app usage data,\n  Fitness and Wellness Data, online and offline purchasing behaviors,\n  interaction with our ads or marketing emails, similar types of\n  information, and in some cases, data from third parties.\n\n  **United States Note**: The audience segments are made available for\n  interest-based advertising for third party advertising on the\n  MyFitnessPal Services.\n\n- **Interest-Based Advertising Opt Outs, Choices, and Control.** For\n  all of the interest-based advertising described above, including\n  segments, you have the choice to not have your data used to target\n  and serve you interest-based advertising-including third party\n  advertising-regardless of where such ads might be served. These\n  opt-outs require that strictly necessary cookies are not blocked by\n  the settings in your web browser. We support the Self-Regulatory\n  Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the [Digital\n  Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/) in the US, the\n  [Canadian Digital Advertising Alliance](https://youradchoices.ca/)\n  in Canada, and the [European Digital Advertising\n  Alliance](http://www.edaa.eu/European-principles/) in the EU. If you\n  live in the United States, Canada, or the European Union, you can\n  visit [Ad Choices](http://optout.aboutads.info/) (US), [Your Ad\n  Choices](http://youradchoices.ca/choices/) (Canada), or [Your Online\n  Choices](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) (EU) to find a\n  convenient place to opt-out of interest-based advertising with\n  participating entities for each region. These websites also provide\n  detailed information about how interest-based advertising works.\n  Opting out does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising\n  from us, or when you use the Internet. It just means that the data\n  collected from our website will not be used for interest-based\n  advertising and that the advertising you see displayed on websites\n  will not be customized to your interests.\n  _Mobile App_. You may opt out of interest-based advertising on\n  mobile devices by activating the “Limit Ad Tracking” or equivalent\n  feature offered by your mobile platform. It will transmit a signal\n  to us and to third-parties that indicates your data should not be\n  used for interest-based advertising.\n\nOur [Cookie and Device ID Use](#cookie-use-and-controls) section\nprovides additional options for controlling the use of particular kinds\nof cookies, including advertising cookies. You may use our “advertising\ncookies” toggle in these settings to prohibit the collection and use of\nPersonal Data in cookies for interest-based advertising.\n\n## Managing Preferences and Withdrawing Consent\n\nYou may at any time withdraw your consent with future effect and without\naffecting the lawfulness of processing of your Personal Data based on\nthe consent you provided before you withdrew it, and exercise other\ncontrols regarding website and online data collection, interest-based\nadvertising, your communication settings, and app preferences.\nCollection and use of Personal Data may be required for the Services to\nwork.\n\nWe provide you several ways to manage your preferences:\n\n### Cookie Use and Controls\n\nCookies serve a wide variety of purposes. Cookies are pieces of data\nstored in your web browser that are transmitted to websites to remember\nyour browser over time and distinguish it from other users. Cookies are\nused to personalize your web experience and for security, analytics,\nmarketing, and interest-based advertising. Our cookies are placed and\nread by our web servers, while other cookies are placed and read by\nother companies’ web servers. Information on specific cookies is found\non our website via the \u003cspan id='adChoices'\u003eadchoices link\u003c/span\u003e.\nYou can block and control cookies using the information noted in this\nsection. If you block all cookies, certain functionality on our Website\nwill not work.\n\nOne way to think about cookies is based on their function. The following\nsettings will control our use of browser cookies, the use of IP address\nfor tracking, and the collection and use of data for cookie-based,\ninterest-based advertising.\n\n\\[ IN \\] **Required Cookies.** These strictly necessary cookies are used\nfor core functionality, and recognize when you are signed in, are\nnecessary for security, and enforce your privacy preferences. Without\nthese cookies, some functionality on our Website may fail. You can block\nthese cookies in your browser preferences.\n\n\\[ IN / OUT \\] **Functional Cookies.** These cookies help to improve the\nWebsite by allowing us to understand how the Website is used and how the\nWebsite performs. These cookies include analytics and measurement.\n\n\\[ IN / OUT \\] **Advertising Cookies.** These cookies help us and other\nparties personalize ads that are shown to you on the Services, as well\nas on other websites. If enabled, these cookies will allow third parties\nengaged in interest-based advertising on our Website to recognize your\nbrowser software on other websites too.\n\n### IP Address Use\n\nAn IP address refers to an identifier assigned by a network to a\ncomputer, mobile device, Internet of Things (IoT) device, or routing\ndevice. IP addresses, for purposes of this Privacy Policy, include\n“public” IP addresses, such as the IP address for a home router that is\nvisible to the Internet, as well as “local” IP addresses, which are IP\naddresses assigned to computers and mobile devices “behind” a router\n(such as a home router). Our advertising and analytics partners may use\nIP addresses to group or correlate devices for purposes of analytics,\nsecurity and anti-fraud purposes, interest-based advertising, ad\ntargeting, ad attribution, and limiting ad frequency.\n\nYou can choose not to have IP address used for purposes of advertising\nor analytics by using the cookie controls for “Advertising Cookies,” and\n“Performance/Analytics,” above.\n\n### Web Pixels or Beacons Use\n\nPixels are extremely small image files that, when loaded by your web\nbrowser, cause the browser to make a network request to the party\ncorresponding to the pixel. If that party’s cookies are currently stored\nin your browser, those cookies will be transmitted with the request.\nBeacons can be used on web pages for advertising or to confirm the\nopening of a marketing email. When used in conjunction with cookies for\ninterest-based-advertising, the cookie controls above can be used to\ncontrol the purpose for which they are used.\n\n### HTML5 Local Storage\n\nHTML5 Local Storage in the browser is different from cookies, but can be\nused for the same purpose (to pair a tracking ID to a particular web\nserver with your web browser so that the web server can identify your\nweb browser over time). You can control the purpose for which HTML5\nLocal Storage is used by using the cookie controls outlined above.\n\n### Social Network Interaction and Widgets\n\nSocial network widgets, buttons, and plug-ins on our Website passively\ntransmit data regarding a social network’s members to that social\nnetwork, even when a button is not clicked. These technologies may allow\na social network (e.g., Facebook) to personally identify its members and\nto know the web pages its members have visited. This is true wherever\nsocial network buttons are embedded, regardless of whether a button is\n“clicked” or “pressed.” If you belong to a social network or use these\ncategories of web services, you should review the privacy policies of\nthose services to understand the nature of the data that they collect\nand what, if any, options the service offers to control how data is\ncollected and used. If you disable advertising cookies, the passive\ntracking associated with these buttons will be blocked on our sites.\n\n### Mobile Device Advertising IDs, Location, Sensor Data, and In-Range Device Data Use\n\nOur Services may transmit Device IDs, general location data, and data\nfrom sensors to us and our partners, including our advertising partners.\n\n- _Device IDs_ include IDs associated with your mobile device carrier\n  such as IMEI, MEID, IMSI; platform-specific IDs such as Android ID,\n  Google AID, and Apple’s IDFA; and IDs that are part of your device\n  hardware, such as WiFi MAC address, and serial number. Exactly which\n  Device IDs are transmitted can depend on your mobile device platform\n  and the version of your operating system.\n\n- _General Location Data_. Our Services may transmit general location\n  data. General location data may be obtained from GPS services, cell\n  tower triangulation, or known location of nearby WiFi access points.\n\n- _Sensor and In-Range Device Data_. Our apps and Services may also\n  collect Device IDs and network addresses (including IP addresses,\n  MAC addresses, and SSIDs) from other, in-range or networked devices\n  and WiFi Access Points.\n\n- _How We Use Mobile Device Data_. We may use Device IDs, coarse\n  location and general location data, and data from sensors, including\n  the local network, (together with app usage data and Fitness and\n  Wellness Data) for strictly necessary purposes; improving our apps\n  and analytics; personalization and preferences; and cross-app,\n  cross-device, interest-based advertising.\n\n### Withdraw Your Consent for Use of Your Mobile Device IDs for Analytics and Advertising\n\nActivating the “Limit Ad Tracking,” “Opt out of Ads Personalization,” or\nequivalent setting from your mobile device will transmit a signal to us\nand any third parties that we use. When that signal is received by\nMyFitnessPal or third parties, it communicates your choice to not have\nDevice IDs used for purposes of advertising or analytics. We honor the\nsignal and require that our third party advertising and analytics\npartners do the same.\n\nTo the extent our App personalizes functionality for you, you can change\nthese settings within the App, or reset to defaults by deleting and\nreinstalling the App.\n\n### Change Consent Settings for Communication Preferences \n\n**Consent for Email Communication:** After signing up for email\ncommunications, you can choose to unsubscribe using the unsubscribe link\nin any commercial email we send. Please note that if you unsubscribe\nfrom “all emails” this means “all emails other than strictly necessary\nemails.” You will still receive email communications from us if they are\nstrictly necessary to provide the Services or to confirm or validate a\ntransaction, recover accounts, etc.\n\n**Mobile Push Notifications:** You can manage the type of push\nnotifications you receive from MyFitnessPal by modifying the settings\nwithin the App. For more information on how to update your push\nnotification settings for our Services please visit\n[here](https://support.myfitnesspal.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032623051-How-do-I-set-up-push-notifications-).\nYou may also set your mobile device settings to not allow push\nnotifications from us.\n\n## Transfers of Your Personal Data to Other Countries\n\nThe Personal Data MyFitnessPal processes, and all associated Services\nand systems, including registration, is housed on servers in the United\nStates.
